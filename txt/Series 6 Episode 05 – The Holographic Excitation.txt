Series 6 Episode 05 – The Holographic Excitation

   Scene: The Comic Book Store

   Howard: Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my
   trip to space.

   Stuart: Well, Howard, that’s very nice of you.

   Leonard: Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

   Howard: It’s my official NASA portrait.

   Stuart: To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world.
   Just like the guy in this picture was.”

   Sheldon: For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the
   dry cleaners are out of this world.

   Howard: That’s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon
   for their store-brand antacids.

   Raj: Hey, Stuart, I see you’re getting ready for your Halloween
   party.

   Stuart: Yeah, it’s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth
   time’s the charm.

   Raj: Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais
   quois when it comes to soirees.

   Stuart: Thanks, but I can’t afford je ne sais quois. How much
   for just quois?

   Raj: You know, you don’t worry about money. I’ll take care of
   everything.

   Stuart: Really?

   Raj: Yeah, you’ll love it. Ain’t no party like a Koothra-party.

   Howard: But you know what wasn’t a party? That hotel in
   Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it’s
   your last night on Earth. You’d think you’d get one porn
   channel.

   Leonard: Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and
   use it to remind you that he went to space?

   Sheldon: Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific
   method, perform an experiment.

   Leonard: Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get
   dinner?

   Howard: Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner
   was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don’t go there for
   the food, you go there for the view.

   Sheldon: It’s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the
   result. Howard, I’ve always thought the lemon was an underrated
   fruit. Care to weigh in?

   Howard: Not really.

   Sheldon: Oh, well.

   Howard: You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon.
   But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar

   Amy: Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any
   better than this?

   Penny: I hope so.

   Amy: Question. Do you think your husband’s fondness for
   turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing
   foreskin?

   Penny: It’s not getting any better. (Text tone) Ugh. It’s
   Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.

   Bernadette: I thought you liked Halloween.

   Penny: I do, it’s just he wants to go to that party at the
   comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are
   kind of creepy.

   Bernadette: Like my husband?

   Amy: And my boyfriend?

   Penny: I’m, I’m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about
   Howard’s foreskin?

   Bernadette: Nice try, but you have to go to that party because
   we’re going.

   Penny: Yeah, I’m gonna go. It’s just not my idea of a good
   time.

   Bernadette: Leonard does thing he doesn’t like to make you
   happy.

   Penny: Well, yeah, he’s my boyfriend. Isn’t that, like, his
   job?

   Amy: Then what’s your job?

   Penny: Letting him make me happy.

   Bernadette: I just think in relationships you get back what you
   put into them.

   Amy: That’s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best
   come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came
   to be cultivated.

   Penny: I guess I could probably try a little harder.

   Bernadette: You could start by taking an interest in his work.

   Penny: Yeah, that’s kind of a problem.

   Amy: Why?

   Penny: Not really clear on what he does.

   Bernadette: He’s an experimental physicist.

   Penny: Yeah, I’m not really clear on what that means.

   Amy: He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine
   their accuracy.

   Penny: Yeah, you’re really just making it worse.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: What kind of tea would you like?

   Amy: I think I’m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.

   Sheldon: Two tea bags in one cup? You’re not at a rave.

   Amy: So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna
   be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I
   thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.

   Sheldon: I couldn’t agree more.

   Amy: Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know
   about you.

   Sheldon: Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of
   the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this,
   you and I entering Stuart’s party and all eyes turn to see
   America’s most beloved and glamorous couple.

   Amy: Yeah?

   Sheldon: R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.

   Amy: Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo
   and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots
   from some silly movie I don’t even like.

   Sheldon: Okay, I’m gonna let that slide because I know you’re
   hopped up on tea bags.

   Amy: I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once,
   can’t we find something that we’re both happy with?

   Sheldon: Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and
   influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard.
   Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?

   Scene: Leonard’s laboratory.

   Penny: Anybody home?

   Leonard: Hey, what are you doing here?

   Penny: I just thought I’d stop by and say hello.

   Leonard: Oh, what a nice surprise. I don’t think you’ve ever
   seen my lab before.

   Penny: No, I know. It’s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better
   not be building a robot girlfriend.

   Leonard: No. Although Howard was making some real strides in
   that area until he met Bernadette.

   Penny: You’re kidding.

   Leonard: Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box
   waiting for the phone to ring.

   Penny: Ooh! What’s going on in here?

   Leonard: Oh, no, no, no, don’t look in there.

   Penny: What, is it secret?

   Leonard: No, it’s a nitrogen laser. It’ll cook your eyeball
   like a soft-boiled egg.

   Penny: Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.

   Leonard: Sign right there.

   Penny: Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What’s, what’s that?

   Leonard: Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight
   mass spectrometer.

   Penny: Wow. High-techie-techie. What’s this little box?

   Leonard: That is a pencil sharpener.

   Penny: Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on
   right now?

   Leonard: It’s actually pretty neat.

   Penny: Yeah?

   Leonard: Yeah. It’s a front-projected holographic display
   combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I’ll show you.
   We’ll just put this pencil over here.

   Penny: Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.

   Leonard: Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective
   surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears.
   Leonard moves it around with his finger)

   Penny: Wow. That is amazing.

   Leonard: You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory
   that the whole universe may be a hologram.

   Penny: What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram
   changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!

   Leonard: Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that
   what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really
   (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes
   view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest
   reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it’s
   possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting
   on the largest canvas in the universe.

   Penny: Hmm.

   Leonard: What?

   Penny: Sometimes I forget how smart you are.

   Leonard: You should visit more often. What are you doing?

   Penny: Take off your clothes.

   Leonard: What? Here? Now?

   Penny: Yeah. You got a problem with that?

   Leonard: No, no. It’s kind of crazy. I’ve never fooled around
   in the lab before.

   Penny: Really? Never?

   Leonard: No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the
   extension cord wasn’t long enough.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Raj: Before I forget, I’d like your opinion on the menus I’ve
   prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes
   bump in the night.

   Howard: Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.

   Raj: On Sesame seed Bunzillas.

   Sheldon: Night of the Living Garlic Bread?

   Raj: It’s funny because bread sounds like dead.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the
   names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no
   way Halloweenie.

   Raj: Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That’s a good one. They’ll pair
   nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?

   Howard: That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA
   jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be,
   like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work
   clothes, you nut?

   Leonard: Hello, boys.

   Sheldon: What are you smiling at?

   Leonard: Nothing.

   Howard: You know where’s there’s a lot of nothing.

   All: Space.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.

   Howard: Boy, it’s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again.
   Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my
   mouth and into the air lock?

   Bernadette: Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.

   Howard: So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What
   to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for
   booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to
   jettison that nightgown?

   Bernadette: Okay, we need to talk.

   Howard: What?

   Bernadette: Howie, I know you went to space. I’m incredibly
   proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up
   every minute.

   Howard: I don’t talk about it every minute.

   Bernadette: Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour
   straight.

   Howard: What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at
   Johnny Rockets.

   Bernadette: I’m just saying, people are getting a little tired
   of it.

   Howard: So, I did this amazing thing and I’m never allowed to
   mention it?

   Bernadette: Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be
   to wait for people to bring it up.

   Howard: Okay, no problem. It won’t happen again.

   Bernadette: I love you.

   Howard: I love you, too. I can’t tell you how many times I
   dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was… you know. What,
   I can’t even point?

   Scene: Leonard’s lab.

   Leonard: So, basically, this is what’s called mag-lev
   technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a
   force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.

   Penny: Whoa! That’s heavy.

   Leonard: Yeah. Oh, uh, you don’t have on any jewellery, do you?

   Penny: No. Why?

   Leonard: A grad student forgot to take out one of his
   piercings. Now he’s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple
   his size. Now watch this.

   Penny: Whoa! That is very cool.

   Leonard: Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I’m the
   super villain Magneto.

   Penny: Getting a little less cool, Leonard.

   Leonard: But what I really am is a very smart scientist who
   understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the
   sexy black underwear you bought him.

   Penny: There we go.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Raj: So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either
   be creepy like a mummy’s tomb, or they also have the Tardis
   from Doctor Who.

   Sheldon: A Tardis makes no sense. It’s a time machine from a
   science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That
   being said, if you don’t get a Tardis, you stink and your party
   stinks.

   Raj: Do you have a preference?

   Howard: I don’t care. Get the Tardis.

   Sheldon: Yes! This party just became a major rager.

   Raj: Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?

   Howard: Yeah, sure, whatever.

   Raj: I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones’
   mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.

   Howard: Clever.

   Raj: What’s wrong with you?

   Howard: Nothing.

   Raj: Oh, Howard, I’ve got a party to plan. Don’t make me pull
   it out of you.

   Howard: Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick
   of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Raj: No.

   Sheldon: We seem to have different approaches here. I was going
   for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you’re doing.

   Raj: It’s called being nice.

   Sheldon: Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up,
   I’ll try it.

   Howard: You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won’t talk
   about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.

   Sheldon: Look at that, the problem solved itself.

   Leonard: Hello, boys.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt
   and pepper?

   Amy: You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William
   was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about
   Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.

   Sheldon: No, I don’t think so. Those dolls represent three
   things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I
   think it’s a lost cause.

   Amy: No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have
   a boyfriend, and he’s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys
   and sex tapes. Pick one.

   Sheldon: What’s a hickey?

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette
   are dressed as smurfs.

   Bernadette: How do I look?

   Howard: Fine.

   Bernadette: Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie,
   that’s like the funniest thing I’ve ever said in my life. What
   do you say? You ready to go?

   Howard: To tell you the truth, I’m not really in the mood.

   Bernadette: What are you talking about? It’ll be fun. All your
   friends’ll be there.

   Howard: Yeah, some friends. They all think I’m boring. Maybe
   you should go without me.

   Bernadette: No, if I’m there alone, people might think I’m just
   a really short person from Avatar.

   Howard: I’m sorry. I just don’t want to go.

   Bernadette: Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring
   myself blue. I’m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a
   month.

   Howard: Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.

   Bernadette: Yeah, well, now you’re a Smurf. Keep walking.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Penny: Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.

   Bernadette: Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?

   Penny: No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two
   badges.

   Bernadette: And Albert Einstein?

   Leonard: Ja, und later she’s going to arrest me for goink
   fashter zen da shpeed of light.

   Penny: I thought we said in the car, no accents?

   Leonard: Sorry, Officer.

   Girl dressed as a Witch: Hello. It’s a great party.

   Stuart: Thank you.

   Witch: The monster foods, they’re really fun.

   Stuart: Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like
   that because I’m fun. I’m not clinically depressed at all.

   Amy: Sheldon, get in here.

   Sheldon: I should’ve picked hickey.

   Stuart: Hey, hey, look at you guys!

   Amy: I’m Raggedy Ann, and he’s Raggedy C-3PO.

   Sheldon: It was a compromise. I lost.

   Raj: Can you believe Stuart’s walking around taking credit for
   this party?

   Howard: Who cares?

   Raj: What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off
   here. The DJ’s on fire, there’s a Tardis photo booth in the
   back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft
   Draculoni and cheese.

   Howard: You’re right, the party’s fantastic. Please, tell me
   more. I haven’t heard enough about it all week because hearing
   about that never gets old.

   Raj: Is this about the space thing again?

   Howard: Well, I’m not allowed to talk about it, but since you
   brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space,
   space! Space!

   Bernadette: Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?

   Howard: Great, now I’m in trouble. You happy?

   Bernadette: You, out! You are being very rude.

   Howard: No, I’m not. They’re all being rude. And you’re being
   rude.

   Bernadette: Me? What did I do?

   Howard (in a squeaky voice): Oh, Howie, stop talking about
   space so much. Nobody likes it.

   Bernadette (in a gruff voice): I don’t sound like that.

   Howard: You’re my wife. You’re supposed to be on my side.

   Bernadette: I’m always on your side.

   Howard: Then why are you trying to take this away from me?
   Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I’m ever gonna do. If I
   stop talking about it, then I’m just…

   Bernadette: Just what?

   Howard: Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.

   Bernadette: Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.

   Howard: You’re just saying that.

   Bernadette: No, I’m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.

   Howard: I love you.

   Bernadette: I love you, too.

   Penny (emerging from Tardis): Nothing to see here. Just sexy
   police business.

   Leonard: Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s bedroom.

   Bernadette: Hey, what you watching?

   Howard: I don’t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.

   Buzz (on video, handing Halloween candy to children): Here you
   go. It’s a Milky Way. The Milky Way’s a galaxy in space. I’ve
   been in space. Here’s a Mars bar. I’m an astronaut. And this
   one’s a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?

   Howard: Okay, I get it.
