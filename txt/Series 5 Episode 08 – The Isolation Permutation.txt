Series 5 Episode 08 – The Isolation Permutation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid
   dresses?

   Bernadette: Well, if you don’t mind looking like an orange
   traffic cone, great.

   Amy: Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.

   Bernadette: Really?

   Amy: Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family
   died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before
   her wedding.

   Bernadette: That’s horrible.

   Amy: Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused
   and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of
   odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it
   out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.

   Bernadette: I don’t know. Dead people’s dresses?

   Penny: Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.

   Amy: Uh, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice. Irene was always a
   slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as
   it turned out, space heaters.

   Sheldon: Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an
   intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well
   as the stomach. But through no one’s fault, Penny, the quality
   of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And
   again, I’m looking at no one in particular, Penny.

   Leonard: Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?

   Howard: What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you
   hate us?

   Sheldon: I’ve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to
   both the advanced and novice conversationalists.

   Penny: Okay, that time you looked at me.

   Amy: Who didn’t? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have
   pores?

   Sheldon: Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN,
   paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of
   holes as their cheese? And converse.

   Penny: All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at
   bridal magazines?

   Bernadette: Oh, me.

   Penny: Through no one’s fault, Sheldon, we’re leaving.

   Amy: Wait for moi.

   Sheldon: You’re leaving?

   Amy: Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I’m a lady. And with that
   comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy
   magazines that make me hate my body.

   Sheldon: Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or
   bat-crap crazy?

   Raj: Totally. What’s wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the
   right figure for it, they’re adorable.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?

   Amy: Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions
   for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

   Sheldon: She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.

   Amy: It’s hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious,
   and yet somehow you do it.

   Howard: That’s fun to have in a lunchroom.

   Amy: The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you’re
   going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little
   mother who’s been biting you all week.

   Howard: Please, we’re eating. Can we get that off the table and
   change the subject?

   Sheldon: Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into
   a conver-sensation.

   Leonard: This time, it’s your fault.

   Sheldon: I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come
   on, people, it’s just a giant thistle, to zzz, the
   onamona-poetry of sleep.

   Leonard: Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease
   to kill me?

   Amy: I don’t know, four or five years.

   Leonard: No, it’s not gonna do it.

   Howard: Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in
   bridesmaid dresses.

   Amy: They’re out shopping right now?

   Howard: Yeah.

   Amy: Just the two of them?

   Howard: I guess.

   Amy: That’s cool, that’s cool.

   Howard: Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows
   what a sweetheart neckline is? (Raj raises his hand)

   Scene: The apartment. Leonard is horseracing on a Kinnect game.

   Leonard: Leonard’s coming down the home stretch! Come on,
   horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can
   do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if
   I weren’t too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you’re up.

   Sheldon: What?

   Leonard: Come on, it’s your turn. We said we’d get more fresh
   air.

   Sheldon: Sorry. I’m a little distracted. I can’t seem to get in
   touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her,
   posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.

   Leonard: Did you try calling her on the telephone?

   Sheldon: The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple
   way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and
   curiouser.

   Leonard: If you’re worried, we can go over there and see if
   she’s all right.

   Sheldon: Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been
   spotted in her neighbourhood.

   Leonard: I don’t think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.

   Sheldon: Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?

   Leonard: You do?

   Sheldon: Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local
   news item. Now, thanks to you, I’m worried Amy’s been eaten by
   a bobcat.

   Leonard: Forget about the bobcat.

   Sheldon: How can I? You won’t stop talking about it.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing the harp.

   Amy (singing): Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries.
   Everybody hurts, sometimes.

   Sheldon (outside): She sounds weepy. I don’t like weepy. Let’s
   go.

   Leonard: Uh, she’s your friend. Step up.

   Leonard: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.
   (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Bye.

   Sheldon: Where are you going?

   Leonard: I’m single, I don’t need this crap.

   Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?

   Sheldon: You didn’t respond to any of my electronic
   communications.

   Amy: I wanted to be alone.

   Sheldon: Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that
   no is a perfectly viable answer.

   Amy: Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.

   Sheldon: Point of order. As you’re in distress, it would be
   customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I’m a guest
   in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a
   beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?

   Amy: It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters.

   Sheldon: If you’d like to take your mind off what’s troubling
   you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.

   Amy: Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses
   without me.

   Sheldon: And that made you feel sad?

   Amy: Yes.

   Sheldon: I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I’m good at this.

   Amy: It’s just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I
   guess I was fooling myself.

   Sheldon: When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a
   beverage? ‘Cause I can see how that could stick in someone’s
   craw.

   Amy: Sheldon, I’m going to ask you something, and I’d like you
   to keep an open mind.

   Sheldon: Always.

   Amy: At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and
   physical contact.

   Sheldon: Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.

   Amy: Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes
   my soul and inflames my loins.

   Sheldon: Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and
   repeat, aw, who’s a good Amy.

   Amy: How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven
   culminating in second base.

   Sheldon: Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.

   Amy: We cuddle. Final offer.

   Sheldon: Very well. Oh, boy. (They cuddle, awkwardly.)

   Amy: I’m just saying, second base is right there.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Raj: Mm, I’m thinking about adopting some quirky affectation,
   like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.

   Leonard: For all those girls out there looking for the Indian
   Monopoly man?

   Raj: This is not a safe place. You can’t share anything here.

   Sheldon: The two of you need to get your women in line!

   Howard: What?

   Sheldon: Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp
   music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on
   a night that I had originally designated for solving the
   space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego
   Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went
   out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action
   they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect
   me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.

   Howard: What do you want us to do about it?

   Sheldon: You clearly weren’t listening to my topic sentence,
   get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set
   things right. I am a man of science, not someone’s snuggle
   bunny!

   Leonard: Why do I have to talk to Penny? She’s not my
   girlfriend.

   Sheldon: You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything
   about her is on you, you make it so!

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Moo-shu is Penny.

   Penny: Thank you. Where’s Sheldon?

   Leonard: Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early
   dinner and put him to bed.

   Bernadette: That’s so sweet.

   Leonard: Yeah, but now he’s gonna be up at dawn and want to
   play.

   Howard: So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because
   he was taking care of Amy. She’s kind of upset.

   Penny: Why?

   Leonard: Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress
   shopping without her.

   Bernadette: I told you that would happen.

   Penny: Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid
   and she’s just getting a little crazy with it.

   Bernadette: She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid
   traditions in other cultures, and they’re all about getting
   naked and washing each other.

   Penny: Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles
   have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers

   Bernadette: We thought it would be easier to look at dresses
   one time without her. I feel terrible.

   Penny: I know. Me, too. We’ll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did
   she find out?

   Howard: Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I’m
   sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn’t thinking.

   Bernadette: Oh, Howie.

   Howard: Well, hey, I’m usually pretty good at not blabbing. You
   tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.

   Penny: What do you tell him?

   Bernadette: Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have
   nothing to worry about.

   Leonard: Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?

   Penny: No. All your little secrets are fine.

   Bernadette: Yes, absolutely fine.

   Howard (after Raj whispers to him): I’ll tell you later.

   Scene: Amy’s lab. Amy is dissecting a brain.

   Amy: Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive
   little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same
   reaction you had when you got the news.

   Penny: Hi.

   Bernadette: Hello.

   Amy: What are you doing here?

   Penny: Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing
   you with us the other day.

   Amy: That’s not necessary, it’s like Sesame Street says, one of
   these things is not like the other, one of these things should
   die alone.

   Penny: Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you.
   We’ll have a girl’s night, we’ll do whatever you want.

   Bernadette: We can go down to the Korean baths and do that
   thing you were talking about where we wash each other.

   Penny: With-with loofah mitts, no hands.

   Amy: It’s okay. I’m glad this happened. I can stop pretending
   that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-

   the-right-light friend want to hang out with me.

   Bernadette: Amy, we’re really sorry.

   Penny: Yeah, we feel awful.

   Amy: Don’t. I’ll be okay. You’re not the first girls I thought
   were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It’s like
   elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad
   school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.

   Penny: Oh, come on, Amy.

   Amy: You don’t get it. Look at this brain.

   Penny: I don’t really want to.

   Amy: This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific
   left hemisphere. Penny, you’re the creative, spontaneous right
   hemisphere. And where’s Amy? She’s right here, the sad little
   tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.

   Bernadette: Amy, you’re not a tumour. Penny, tell her she’s not
   a tumour. (Penny is vomiting in the dustbin).

   Scene: The apartment, Sheldon is building his Lego Death Star.
   Phone rings.

   Sheldon: Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented
   the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like
   it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I’m sorry, I bet
   my sweet what? Well, all right. We’re on our way.

   Leonard: What’s going on?

   Sheldon: It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking
   lot.

   Leonard: Really? Amy?

   Sheldon: Leonard, be glad you can’t keep a woman. They are a
   handful.

   Scene: A liquor store parking lot.

   Amy: Oh, look. It’s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little
   Leonard.

   Leonard: Hi, Amy.

   Amy: Hey, Cuddles.

   Leonard: Cuddles?

   Sheldon: Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.

   Leonard: Amy, what are you doing here?

   Amy: Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny
   taught me to do when you’re sad.

   Leonard: Yeah, but why didn’t you go back to your apartment?

   Amy: Didn’t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are
   where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards
   ever invited me.

   Leonard: Maybe we should get you home.

   Amy: Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take
   for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch,
   take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with
   me?

   Leonard: Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?

   Sheldon: I’m begging both of you, please, let’s go.

   Leonard: Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.

   Amy: Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.

   Scene: Amy’s lab. She is dissecting a brain.

   Amy: I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my
   frontal lobe, too.

   Penny: Hi.

   Amy: What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship
   bracelet back?

   Penny: I never gave you a friendship bracelet.

   Amy: When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to
   me. You can have it back if you want.

   Penny: No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.

   Bernadette: We know you’re upset, and you have every right to
   be, but if it’s okay with you, we’d like a second chance to
   make things right.

   Penny: We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some
   way to show you how much we care about you.

   Bernadette: Which is why it would mean so much if you would
   agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.

   Amy: What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in
   Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny
   otter?

   Bernadette: No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.

   Amy: Oh, my gosh. No one’s every asked me to be the maid of
   honour before. Well, that’s not true. Once, but then they all
   died.

   Bernadette: So is that a yes?

   Amy: Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There’s
   the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do
   for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we’ll go to a Native
   American sweat lodge, we’ll take peyote, roll around in the
   mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette’s naked body. So
   that’s happening.

   Penny: Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.

   Amy: I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal.
   Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette?
   No? Penny?

   Penny: Sorry.

   Amy: Really?

   Penny: Okay, yeah.

   Amy: Yay!

   Scene: A bridal store.

   Amy: Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler’s amazing
   behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.

   Bernadette: We’re just trying on dresses, do we really need to
   record this?

   Amy: I’m sorry, are you the maid of honour?

   Bernadette: I am the bride.

   Amy: So no. And action.

   Penny (in a red bridesmaid dress): What do you think?

   Bernadette: I love it!

   Amy: What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let’s see some skin.

   Cut to Amy in a lilac dress.

   Bernadette: Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!

   Amy: You think they don’t have mirrors in there? I know how I
   look.

   Cut to Bernadette in a wedding dress.

   Penny: Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!

   Amy: You do.

   Bernadette: Thank you.

   Amy: Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.

   Cut to changing room door.

   Amy: Come on, bestie, you’re up.

   Penny (off): Give me a minute.

   Amy: What is taking you so long? (Opens door. Penny is in her
   underwear)

   Penny: Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!

   Amy: – Sorry, sorry. (Swings camera away. Then back again)

   Penny: Oh, God. Amy!

   Amy: Sorry.
