Series 4 Episode 18 – The Prestidigitation Approximation

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom

   Priya: Morning.

   Leonard: Morning.

   Priya: Sleep okay?

   Leonard: Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?

   Priya: Sure.

   Leonard: Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the
   Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?

   Priya: Yeah, just because you’re in bed with an Indian woman,
   you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from
   an ancient Indian love manual?

   Leonard: Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with
   white boys, I’d be okay with that.

   Priya: No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought
   about getting contacts?

   Leonard: I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used
   to them.

   Priya: Oh, that’s too bad.

   Leonard: Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest
   debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello
   case.

   Priya: If you had them on now, you could see what we’re going
   to do next.

   Leonard: Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Howard: Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I’ve been working
   on?

   Sheldon: Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of
   friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want
   to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that
   doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a
   thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s
   Nobel prize acceptance speech.

   Raj: Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let’s see it.

   Howard: Here, shuffle these.

   Raj: Okay.

   Howard: Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one,
   look at it.

   Raj: Okay.

   Howard: Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.

   Sheldon: Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?

   Howard: Remind me, what’s your birthday?

   Raj: October sixth.

   Howard: Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero
   is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.

   Raj: How about that!

   Howard: Is that your card?

   Raj: Yes, it is. Very cool!

   Sheldon: It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to
   confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?

   Howard: A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a
   future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.

   Sheldon: Fine. Give me a second.

   Howard: You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells
   like bacon?

   (Leonard enters, bumps into random man)

   Random man: Oh, hey!

   Leonard: Sorry! Oop!

   (Continues across room bumping into nearly everyone in the room
   and knocking many things over)

   Leonard: Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it
   out. I just got contacts.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: One, two, three, four, five. No way.

   Howard: That’s your card, right?

   Penny: Seven of clubs! That is amazing!

   Sheldon: It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a
   combination of manipulation and misdirection with the
   occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.

   Howard: Oh, really? So how did I do it?

   Sheldon: Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more
   important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.

   Howard: I thought you had more important things to think about.

   Sheldon: I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break.
   Oh, let me see those cards.

   Penny: Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.

   Sheldon: Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of
   your community college?

   Leonard: Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes
   shopping.

   Penny: Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never
   get that stupid hoodie off him when we were… well, you look
   great.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Priya: Lets go hang everything up.

   Leonard: Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this
   years ago.

   Howard: So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily
   basis?

   Penny: I’m not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he
   wants.

   Howard: Yeah, I was talking to Raj.

   Penny: Oopsy.

   Sheldon: This deck is rigged in some fashion.

   Howard: Fine. Get another deck and I’ll do the trick with that.

   Sheldon: So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?

   Howard: I’m saying believe in magic, you muggle.

   Penny: You know, well, I’m happy Leonard’s found someone. Not
   that anybody asked.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom

   Priya: How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?

   Leonard: Just two. Everyday and dress.

   Priya: Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something.

   Leonard: Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you
   take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so
   cruel.

   Priya: Leonard, I’m not breaking up with you.

   Leonard: Oh, okay. So, what’s up?

   Priya: It’s a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here
   all the time.

   Leonard: I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless
   their hard drives crash.

   Priya: I’m just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out
   with my ex-boyfriend?

   Leonard: Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just
   friends.

   Priya: I don’t care. This is a woman you have slept with. If
   you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you’re not
   ready to move on.

   Leonard: No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight
   for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?

   Priya: You need to cut the cord with Penny.

   Leonard: Oh. Okay.

   Priya: You don’t sound very confident.

   Leonard: No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar
   with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the
   first time I’ll be the one saying it.

   Priya: Thank you. I appreciate it.

   Leonard: Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that
   could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically,
   if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear
   it?

   Priya: Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my
   family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe. Can we
   not discuss it?

   Leonard: I’m sorry. I’m, never mind.

   Scene: The apartment

   Howard: And was your card the jack of diamonds?

   Penny: Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?

   Sheldon: Um…

   Penny: Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he
   can’t figure out how I got his nose.

   Howard: You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might
   be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil’s rubber!

   Penny: Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.

   Sheldon: Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know.
   That’s axiomatic.

   Penny: Come here. (Whispers to Howard)

   Howard: You’re right.

   Penny: Not too bad for someone who doesn’t know what axiomatic
   means.

   Scene: The laundry room.

   Leonard: Oh, hi.

   Penny: Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?

   Leonard: One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped
   back into my skull.

   Penny: Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: You don’t wanna wash that.

   Leonard: No?

   Penny: No, that’s silk. Seriously, what would you do without
   me?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real
   winner with Priya.

   Leonard: Yeah, me, too.

   Penny: She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to
   take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.

   Leonard: Yeah, bitches are the worst.

   Penny: All right, well I’ll see you later.

   Leonard: Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with
   Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?

   Penny: Did they make a movie about it?

   Leonard: No.

   Penny: Then no.

   Leonard: All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two
   groups of finches competed over the same food source,
   eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so
   they could feed on something else.

   Penny: Okay.

   Leonard: So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour
   that we can apply to our own lives?

   Penny: Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?

   Leonard: Sure, that has birds in it.

   Penny: It’s fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.

   Leonard: I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom

   Priya: Do you really have to wear that in bed?

   Leonard: Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during
   the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.

   Priya: So did you get to talk to Penny?

   Leonard: Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.

   Priya: And?

   Leonard: She completely understood everything I said. Case
   closed.

   Priya: Was she upset?

   Leonard: Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my
   girlfriend, you are.

   Priya: I hope you weren’t cruel to her.

   Leonard: Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is
   that just nature’s way?

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock)
   Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I
   need you to pick a card.

   Leonard: I am not opening that door, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: As you wish. (Cards slide under door) Pick a card, put
   it back, and prepare to be amazed. (Leonard does not) Did you
   pick one?

   Leonard: Yep.

   Sheldon: (Sliding card under door) Is this your card?

   Leonard: (Not looking) Nope.

   Sheldon: Drat. Is this your card?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: I’ll be right back.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is alone.

   Sheldon: Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back
   in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I
   have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards.
   Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.

   Leonard: Whatcha doin’?

   Sheldon: I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.

   Leonard: What’s up with the infrared cameras?

   Sheldon: I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing
   cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you
   hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to
   boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.

   Leonard: Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory?

   Sheldon: Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze
   shuffling patterns.

   Leonard: Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence.
   Hacking into it is a Federal crime.

   Sheldon: Relax, we’re not under attack right now.

   Leonard: Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get
   here.

   Sheldon: And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a
   radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this
   time of night? Come on, Craigslist.

   Scene: A restaurant

   Leonard: Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?

   Priya: It’s okay, I like Indian food.

   Leonard: Or as you probably call it back home, food.

   Priya: Why didn’t you wear your contacts? Don’t you like them?

   Leonard: No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry
   tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.

   Priya: You know, my company offered me a position here in Los
   Angeles.

   Leonard: Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?

   Priya: Maybe. What do you think?

   Leonard:Oh,  I love it. Oh, that’s great!

   Penny (knocking on window): Hi! Hi! Just hang on.

   Leonard: Small world.

   Priya: You did talk to her, didn’t you?

   Leonard: Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.

   Penny: Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes.
   Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn’t look like a mannequin in
   the boys’ department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk
   shirt?

   Priya: No, he did not.

   Penny: He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his
   Spiderman underwear. That’s our Lenny, huh?

   Priya: Yes, that’s our Lenny.

   Penny: So, how’s the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really
   good. Oh, I’m sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out
   anytime. Have fun.

   Leonard: Bye.

   Priya: Good night.

   Penny: Oh, that’s, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks
   up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.

   Leonard: It is pretty spicy.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your
   magic trick.

   Howard: Really?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.

   Howard: I’d love to see that. How about you, Raj?

   Raj: Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?

   Sheldon: All right. Pick a card.

   Howard: Okay.

   Sheldon: Bippity-boppity-boo.

   Howard: What’s with the wand and the beep?

   Sheldon: The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none
   of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message
   completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry
   cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.

   Raj: These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader.
   It’s transmitting to your phone.

   Sheldon: I said, ta-da. Show’s over.

   Howard: That’s pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician
   does it. Raj, take a card. Don’t let me see it.

   Raj: Okay.

   Howard: Three of clubs. (It isn’t)

   Raj: Son of a gun, you’re blowing my mind!

   Howard: Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!

   Sheldon: That does it. I’m getting uranium.

   Raj: You ever gonna tell him?

   Howard: Maybe. When it stops being fun.

   Raj: So never.

   Scene: Penny’s door.

   Penny: Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.

   Leonard: Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.

   Penny: No, it’s all right. Walk me down. So, what’s up?

   Leonard: Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could
   help me with.

   Penny: Sure, anything.

   Leonard: Move out.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a
   family, La Cañada has some great schools.

   Penny: Okay, I’m not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all
   about?

   Leonard: Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella
   ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?

   Penny: Oh, for god’s sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn’t
   it? She doesn’t want me hanging out with you.

   Leonard: Yes. There, I said it.

   Penny: Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.

   Leonard: And she likes you.

   Penny: No, she doesn’t.

   Leonard: Not really, no.

   Penny: It doesn’t matter. Look, I promise from now on I will
   keep my distance from you.

   Leonard: Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we
   talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear
   the toilet flush in your apartment.

   Penny: You can hear my toilet flush?

   Leonard: I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know
   everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.

   Penny: Leonard, I get it. You’re in a new relationship now. And
   I’m happy for you. So why don’t we just shake hands and part
   friends?

   Leonard: Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still
   hang out, but on the down-low?

   Penny: Are you really that kind of guy?

   Leonard: No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the
   down-low.

   Penny: Good-bye, Leonard.

   Leonard: Penny, wait. (Bumps into door) Damned contacts.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Howard: Incoming.

   Raj: Hi!

   Howard: Hey!

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Raj: Why so glum, chum?

   Sheldon: Apparently, you can’t hack into a government
   supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the
   Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.

   Howard: Oh, that’s too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?

   Sheldon: Figure out the magic trick yet?

   Howard: Want me to tell you how to do it?

   Sheldon: No.

   Howard: I’ll show you one more time. Raj?

   Sheldon: Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure
   there’s no monkey business.

   Howard: All right. (Raj looks over Sheldon’s shoulder. Holds
   two fingers over his heart). Two of hearts.

   Sheldon: I hate you.

   Howard: Yeah, he’s gonna win the Nobel prize.
