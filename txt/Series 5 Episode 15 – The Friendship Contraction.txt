Series 5 Episode 15 – The Friendship Contraction

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon enters in a hard hat and
   high-vis jacket. Sounds a klaxon on his phone.

   Leonard: Aaargh. What the hell?

   Sheldon: Emergency preparedness drill.

   Leonard: Oh, no, come on!

   Sheldon: Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our
   readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town
   is probably dead.

   Leonard: I have to get a lock for my door.

   Sheldon: I think you’ll like the drill tonight. I’ve tried to
   make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario
   of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to
   a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any
   catastrophe.

   Leonard: Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.

   Sheldon: Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington
   and Oregon can stop them?

   Leonard: Fine.

   Sheldon: All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates
   Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city
   in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries
   of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat
   and safety vest.

   Leonard: Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our
   apartment dressed like one of the Village People.

   Sheldon: You make that joke every three months. I still don’t
   get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?

   Leonard: I don’t know, what am I doing?

   Sheldon: Look around you, there’s hypothetical broken glass
   everywhere. Really? You’re going to face Armageddon without
   your orthotics? All right, your choice. (Grabs him and pushes
   him over) Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!

   Leonard: Aah!

   Sheldon: And that’s why we wear hard hats.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Howard: Check it out, press release from NASA.

   Raj: Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the
   International Space Station. Crew members will include
   Commander Tom ‘Tombo’ Johnson, astronaut Mike ‘Supernova’
   Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.

   Howard: This is going right into my synagogue’s newsletter.

   Raj: Dude, if you’re going to be an astronaut, you need to pick
   a cool nickname.

   Howard: I don’t get to pick it. The other guys have to give it
   to me.

   Raj: Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.

   Howard: Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have
   to give you your nickname.

   Raj: Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you
   put six sugars in your coffee?

   Leonard: Because the cafeteria doesn’t offer little packets of
   methamphetamine.

   Howard: Emergency drill night last night, huh?

   Leonard: Uh-huh.

   Raj: How’d you do?

   Sheldon: I’ll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness:
   unsatisfactory. Follows direction: barely. Attitude: a little
   too much. Overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery
   inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil
   everyone else’s day.

   Leonard: You know what, I’m so tired I can’t even think
   straight. I’m going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag
   a ride back later?

   Sheldon: You can’t go home. You have to take me to the dentist
   at four o’clock.

   Leonard: Oh, can’t you take the bus to the dentist?

   Sheldon: Of course I can. It’s coming back under the residual
   effects of the anaesthesia, that’s the problem. Two years ago
   after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow
   wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.

   Raj: They put you under for a cleaning?

   Sheldon: Yeah, they have to, I’m a biter.

   Leonard: Whatever, Sheldon. I’m exhausted. I’m not taking you
   to the dentist.

   Sheldon: Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate
   agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me
   to the dentist. See? It’s right here after providing a
   confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.”

   Leonard: You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement.
   It’s ridiculous. I’m your roommate, not your chauffeur. You
   know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all
   the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because
   the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.

   Sheldon: Well, it has. Ask anybody.

   Leonard: I don’t care. I’m done.

   Sheldon: Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause
   209?

   Leonard: I don’t know what that is, but if it means I can go
   home and sleep, then yes.

   Sheldon: Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our
   friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare
   essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only
   be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as
   we pass in the hall. (Demonstrating) ‘Sup?

   Leonard: Where do I sign?

   Sheldon: Right here. Use your finger.

   Leonard: There. Done.

   Sheldon: All right. That’s it. We are now no longer companions,
   boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend
   the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.

   Leonard: I’m gonna go home and take a nap.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly
   to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.

   Penny: What does that mean?

   Bernadette: He’s gonna learn to poop in space.

   Howard: Open the pod bay doors, HAL.

   Raj: Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.

   Sheldon: Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.

   Leonard: ‘Sup?

   Sheldon: ‘Sup? My apologies. I would’ve been here sooner, but
   the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.

   Amy: I saved you a dumpling.

   Sheldon: Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you
   well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.

   Amy: I’m sorry, Sheldon, I’m busy. I’m right in the middle of
   my addiction study. I’ve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys,
   and tomorrow’s the day we switch them to O’Doul’s.

   Sheldon: You’re my girlfriend and you’re not going to cater to
   my every need? Oh, where’d the magic go?

   Penny: Sheldon, that’s not what girlfriends are for. Although,
   you don’t use them for what they’re for, so what do I know?

   Bernadette: Howard doesn’t make me do his shopping, or take him
   to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?

   Howard: Absolutely. But when Ma’s hips give out, you’re up,
   kid.

   Sheldon: Well, if Amy’s too busy, that gives the rest of you an
   opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a
   footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You’re Welcome,
   Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you
   want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to
   that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to
   get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had
   hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist?
   Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here’s a fun one.
   Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for
   Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?

   Raj: Their meatballs are pretty good.

   Sheldon: What’s that?

   Raj: Nothing, nothing.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Sheldon: Hello, Stuart.

   Stuart: Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?

   Sheldon: No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how
   it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.

   Stuart: Ninth?

   Sheldon: You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped
   by pirates. So, uh, how are you?

   Stuart: Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and
   blamed me in the note.

   Sheldon: Great. Great. So, what’s new with your family? How’s
   your mother? Is she alive?

   Stuart: Yeah.

   Sheldon: And your father? Alive?

   Stuart: Yes.

   Sheldon: How about your grandparents, they alive?

   Stuart: No.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I
   have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you
   say you take me over there, buddy boy?

   Stuart: I’m sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?

   Sheldon: Yes. And now, I can’t make any promises, but that’s
   the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the
   number eight friend slot.

   Stuart: Sheldon, I’m working. I can’t take you to the dentist.
   Also, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t want to take you
   to the dentist.

   Sheldon: Can’t help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see
   where your therapist was coming from.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname
   Howard “Buzz” Wolowitz?

   Howard: You can’t do Buzz. Buzz is taken.

   Raj: Buzz Lightyear is not real.

   Howard: No, that’s not what I’m talking about.

   Raj: Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?

   Howard: No.

   Raj: Okay, um, how about Crash”? Howard “Crash” Wolowitz.

   Howard: Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go
   hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.

   Raj: All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?

   Leonard: That’s not bad, Howard “Rocket Man” Wolowitz.

   Howard: Yeah, it’s great, but I told you, I don’t get to pick
   my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.

   Raj: Maybe there’s a way to get them to come up with it.

   Howard: Like how?

   Leonard: Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping
   the other kids would start calling me Duncan.

   Howard: Did it work?

   Leonard: No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they
   took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.

   Raj: Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and
   the next time you talk to those guys, I’ll call you and they’ll
   hear it. Plant the seed.

   Howard: That’s actually not a terrible plan.

   Raj: They don’t call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.

   Leonard (to Sheldon, entering): ‘Sup?

   Sheldon: ‘Sup?

   Leonard: Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?

   Sheldon: Not necessary. No. I found a service that’ll send a
   van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to
   dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.

   Leonard: All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the
   dentist, I will take you to the dentist.

   Sheldon: Are you suggesting that you’ve come to your senses and
   wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full
   participation in the roommate agreement?

   Leonard: Absolutely. If you admit that you’re a 30-year-old man
   who’s incapable of functioning on his own.

   Raj: Ooh, Sock Mouth’s got him on the ropes.

   Sheldon: I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you’ll
   excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get
   my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.

   Scene: The apartment. Leonard is watching television. All the
   power goes off.

   Penny (entering): Oh, good, your power’s out, too.

   Leonard: Why is that good?

   Penny: Because last month, I sent the electric company a
   Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me
   in a bra.

   Sheldon: Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.

   Leonard: What happened to all your
   glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the
   floor?

   Sheldon: Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it’s too bad
   you’re no longer entitled to the full benefits of my
   friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such
   an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light.
   It’s not for you.

   Leonard: It’s just a blackout, I’m sure the power will be back
   on soon.

   Sheldon: And I’m sure some fool in the Donner party said the
   snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him
   first.

   Penny: You know, I got some candles in my apartment.

   Sheldon: But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That’s a
   fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far
   safer glow stick.

   Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre): You call that a glow
   stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let’s go.

   Sheldon: Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a
   deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than
   capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61
   episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All
   yours if you’re willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.

   Penny: I’ve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could
   pop.

   Sheldon: Oh, he’ll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he’s
   gonna be bored out of his mind.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch
   Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts
   urine into drinking water.

   Penny: You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could
   do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want
   to make out?

   Leonard: I thought because our relationship’s in a beta test,
   you wanted to take things slow.

   Penny: Okay. Do you want to make out slow?

   Leonard: I can go so slow it’ll be like there’s a snail in your
   mouth.

   Penny: Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there’s nothing else to do
   right now.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, Leonard.

   Leonard: Since when don’t you knock? It’s like the only good
   thing about you.

   Sheldon: Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We’re in
   a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened
   turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.

   Leonard: Fine, what is it?

   Sheldon: I’m making s’mores. I wanted to alert you in case you
   smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy
   factory was on fire.

   Leonard: S’mores, huh? Good for you.

   Sheldon: Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the
   full roommate agreement.

   Leonard: No, thanks. I’m good.

   Sheldon: Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s’more
   by myself. And then I’m gonna have s’more. By myself.

   Penny: Aw.

   Leonard: No, don’t aw him. He brought this all on himself.

   Penny: But he’s sad.

   Leonard: No, he’s crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so
   it’ll suck you back in.

   Penny: I think he misses his little buddy.

   Leonard: Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus
   teenage make-out session is not over.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: I thought you said candles were dangerous.

   Sheldon: This is a Bunsen burner. I’m a scientist, I know what
   I’m doing. Oh, drat. (His s’more is on fire. He dunks it in a
   glass of water.) Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that
   water.

   Leonard: Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don’t see why we
   can’t be friends. And I’m willing to drive you around and help
   you out with stuff. I just don’t want to do it because of some
   silly roommate agreement.

   Sheldon: What are you proposing?

   Leonard: That we go back to the way things were. But when I do
   something for you, you show a little appreciation.

   Sheldon: And how would I do that?

   Leonard: You say thank you.

   Sheldon: Every time?

   Leonard: It’s not crazy.

   Sheldon: Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate
   agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of
   Mother’s Day or Father’s Day, once a year, we set aside day to
   celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and
   imagined by you. We could call it Leonard’s Day.

   Leonard: I kind of like the sound of that.

   Sheldon: Of course you do. It’s about you, like everything
   else. (Lights come back on) Oh, thank goodness. I don’t think I
   had it in me to make another glass of water.

   Leonard: So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard’s Day?

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: Can I sit in your spot?

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: Can I control the thermostat?

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: Do I get a card?

   Sheldon: Of course you get a card. It’s Leonard’s Day.

   Penny: Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the
   power went out is someone went down into the basement and just
   pulled the main breaker switch.

   Leonard: Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. But whoever that mystery man was,
   you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would
   be no Leonard’s Day.

   Penny: Leonard’s Day?

   Sheldon: Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you’re
   good.

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom.

   Howard: All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good
   song.

   Raj: Oh, yeah. There’s a reason he’s Sir Elton John. They don’t
   make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?

   Howard: Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I
   said don’t bother me!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.

   Howard: Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good
   morning.

   NASA Guy (on skype): Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so
   early.

   Howard: No problem, Dr. Massimino.

   Dr Massimino: The guys here call me Mass.

   Howard: Mass. That’s a cool nickname. ‘Cause force equals mass
   times acceleration.

   Mass: Yeah. It’s just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for
   this morning is to go over the…

   Howard: Sorry. My phone.

   Mass: What is that? Is that Rocket Man?

   Howard: Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket
   Man.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!

   Howard: Not now!

   Mass: Who’s that?

   Howard: My mom. Sorry.

   Howard: No problem, Fruit Loops.
