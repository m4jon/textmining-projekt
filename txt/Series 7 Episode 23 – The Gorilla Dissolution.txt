Series 7 Episode 23 – The Gorilla Dissolution

   Scene: The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Bernadette: Almost there. You’re doing great.

   Howard: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting
   the box.

   Raj: Please hurry.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t need a treadmill.

   Howard: The doctor says you need to get exercise.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise.

   Howard: Crushing my will to live isn’t exercise.

   Raj: If she isn’t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?

   Howard: She’ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing
   pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.

   Raj: All right. Now what?

   Bernadette: We set it up in Howie’s old room.

   Raj: Do you know how to set it up?

   Howard: Please, I’m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can
   handle… Ma, look out.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill
   me.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: So she’s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.

   Leonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.

   Amy: Should we do something for her?

   Sheldon: I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.

   Amy: Sheldon, we’re talking about your friend’s mother. She got
   hurt.

   Sheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I
   changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.

   Penny: Hi.

   Leonard: Hey, how were things on the set?

   Penny: Uh, pretty good, actually.

   Raj: So the movie’s not as bad as you thought?

   Penny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining
   about it, I’m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.

   Amy: Good for you.

   Penny: Thanks. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t be the best
   bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla
   anyone’s ever seen.

   Leonard: I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in
   Schindler’s List is tough to beat.

   Sheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any
   sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the
   Holocaust.

   Leonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: I know.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Howard: Okay, she’s all settled in the guest room.

   Bernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help
   her up the stairs.

   Howard: You mean a forklift?

   Bernadette: Howie.

   Howard: I’m sorry. I just can’t deal with this right now.

   Bernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say
   that?

   Howard: Bernie, she’s gonna be off her feet for six to eight
   weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to
   the toilet?

   Bernadette: I would do it for my mother.

   Howard: Yeah, of course you would, you’re a loving person. I’m
   what my people would call a putz.

   Bernadette: Look, I’m not crazy about the idea, but what other
   choice do we have?

   Howard: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world
   country who’s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.

   Bernadette: You’d hire a total stranger to take care of the
   woman who raised you? That’s so cruel.

   Howard: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the
   music of their homeland.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle.

   Howard: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like
   me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?

   Bernadette: You are a putz.

   Howard: As advertised.

   Scene: A cinema.

   Sheldon: Thanks for coming with me.

   Raj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren’t
   you gonna get 3-D glasses?

   Sheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose
   herpes.

   Raj: Is that a real thing?

   Sheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding
   out.

   Raj: Emily, Hey.

   Emily: Oh, hey, Raj.

   Raj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk
   yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead
   that I should be concerned about?

   Emily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie’s about to
   start.

   Raj: Are you here alone?

   Emily: No, not really.

   Raj: What do you mean, not really?

   Man: Hey, should we get our seats?

   Emily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I’ll call you later.

   Raj: Yeah, okay.

   Sheldon: That was awkward, right?

   Raj: Uh-huh.

   Sheldon: Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that
   other fellow?

   Raj: Yes.

   Sheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.

   Scene: The movie set.

   Director: And action.

   Wil Wheaton: Please don’t shut me out.

   Penny: Go away. Just go away.

   Wil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.

   Penny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a
   killer gorilla?

   Wil: I was trying to save your life.

   Penny: Life? What life? Look at me, I’m a monster. And now I
   have blood on my hands, or paws. I don’t know.

   Wil: You can’t give up. I love you.

   Penny: I love you, too. But I’m afraid I love killing more.
   Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.

   Director: And cut. All right. All right, let’s set up for the
   next scene.

   Penny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I
   could do it better.

   Director: Let’s just move on. No one cares.

   Penny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we’re gonna do this, why
   not try and make it something we’re actually proud of?

   Director: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should
   be happy about that, ’cause if it was a good movie, you
   wouldn’t be in it.

   Leonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.

   Director: And who are you?

   Leonard: I’m her boyfriend.

   Director: Isn’t she too hot for you?

   Leonard: A little, yeah.

   Director: Well, boyfriend, get off my set.

   Penny: You can’t do that. He’s with me.

   Director: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You’re
   fired.

   Penny: What? You can’t fire me. I’m the star. I’m the girl that
   goes bananas. It says so on the poster.

   Director: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see
   your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever
   wears this.

   Wil: Hey, if you’re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me,
   too.

   Scene: A bar.

   Wil: Wow, that fell apart really fast.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn’t sit in that
   theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.

   Sheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare
   I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t
   have all the ingredients to make chai tea.

   Raj: You don’t have to make me anything.

   Sheldon: No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian.
   I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients
   except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?

   Raj: Sorry, I left them in my turban.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed
   your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why
   are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?

   Raj: Wouldn’t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone
   else?

   Sheldon: Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship
   agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone
   other than me.

   Raj: But you don’t have sex with her, either.

   Sheldon: Slick, huh?

   Raj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven’t dated that long, and
   we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.

   Sheldon: Have you had intercourse?

   Raj: No.

   Sheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of
   pressure.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m hungry again.

   Howard: It’s like the world’s fattest cuckoo clock.

   Bernadette: You know, you’re always talking about having a baby
   someday. This is exactly what it’s gonna be like.

   Howard: No, it’s not.

   Bernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping,
   burping, drooling. We’re even waiting for the day when she can
   finally walk on her own.

   Howard: Maybe you’re right. Anything she finds on the floor
   goes right in her mouth.

   Bernadette: I’m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don’t
   expect me to do all the work.

   Howard: Hey, I’m a very paternal person. I’d be excellent at
   taking care of a baby.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’m still hungry.

   Howard: I’m coming, you big baby.

   Scene: The bar.

   Penny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where
   they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie
   where they glue monkey hair to your ass.

   Wil: Forget it, man, it’s crap. You just move on to the next
   thing.

   Penny: Yeah, well, it’s easy for you to say. You used to be
   famous.

   Wil: Hey. I just lost a job for you.

   Penny: All right, I’m sorry, you’re famous.

   Wil: Penny, it’s not about being famous. It’s about the art.
   It’s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message
   tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am
   totally gonna pay you back for this beer.

   Penny: God, what am I doing with my life?

   Leonard: You having second thoughts about acting?

   Penny: You were on set, you saw what it was like.

   Leonard: Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.

   Penny: Oh, really?

   Leonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute
   little theater?

   Penny: It was over a bowling alley.

   Leonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking.

   Penny: Are you done?

   Leonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial.

   Penny: It was for haemorrhoid cream.

   Leonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.

   Penny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.

   Leonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home
   with all five-foot-six of this?

   Penny: Hmm. You think you’re five-foot-six, that’s funny.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: I don’t understand it. I’m a nice guy, I have a great job,
   I’m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don’t women
   want to be with me?

   Sheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night.

   Raj: What? Don’t send me home. I can’t be alone right now.

   Sheldon: That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.

   Raj: What do you mean?

   Sheldon: How many women have you had dates with?

   Raj: Eleven.

   Sheldon: How many of those women did you think would become
   your perfect companion?

   Raj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl
   that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?

   Sheldon: Sure.

   Raj: I’ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.

   Sheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?

   Raj: Maybe. I, I don’t know.It’s late, I should, I should go.
   Look, I do get what you’re saying. Instead of desperately
   clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work
   on my fear of being alone.

   Sheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s
   my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Bernadette: Howie, I’m back!

   Howard: Shh, I just got her to sleep.

   Bernadette: Sorry.

   Howard: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few
   blocks away.

   Bernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a
   different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.

   Howard: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?

   Bernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her,
   excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.

   Howard: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.

   Bernadette: Queen? I’ve been killing myself here.

   Howard: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but
   you were all, I’m nice, I want to take care of people.

   Bernadette: I’m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else
   I’m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard.

   Howard: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj: Hey.

   Emily: Thanks for letting me come over.

   Raj: Of course. Please, come in.

   Emily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I
   want to make sure that we’re okay.

   Raj: Uh, look, you and I haven’t made any commitments to each
   other.

   Emily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I
   was with did my last tattoo, and he’s been asking me out for
   months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.

   Raj: It’s okay.

   Emily: Really?

   Raj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that’s
   my issue, not yours.

   Emily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I’d be pretty
   upset.

   Raj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing
   that could happen.

   Emily: Just so you know, I’m not seeing anyone else.

   Raj: Well, me, neither.

   Emily: Okay.

   Raj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?

   Emily: Yeah.

   Raj: I don’t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may
   not have been a piercing.

   Emily: That’s cool.

   Raj: It’s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?

   Emily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one
   really not on my shoulder.

   Raj: It’s, uh, been a long time since I’ve seen a girl’s really
   not her shoulder.

   Emily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you
   my tattoos?

   Raj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten
   minutes to do some crunches.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Oh, my God. What a day.

   Leonard: Can I get you anything?

   Penny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions.

   Leonard: With your career?

   Penny: With my life.

   Leonard: Like what?

   Penny: I don’t know. We could get married.

   Leonard: Come on, be serious.

   Penny: I am.

   Leonard: Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?

   Penny: Well, yeah.

   Leonard: So I’m like a bran muffin.

   Penny: What? No, that’s not what I’m saying.

   Leonard: No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring
   thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.

   Penny: What does it matter? The point is, I’m choosing you.

   Leonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran
   muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry
   Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could
   give you diabetes.

   Penny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.

   Leonard: No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin.
   Probably fat-free and good for your colon.

   Penny: You know what? Forget it. I never should’ve brought it
   up.

   Leonard: You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing
   this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for
   yourself.

   Penny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that
   movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay?
   I finally realize I don’t need to be famous or have some big
   career to be happy.

   Leonard: Then what do you need?

   Penny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart.

   Leonard: Oh. Then I guess I’m in.

   Penny: Really? You guess you’re in?

   Leonard: Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!

   Penny: Okay. Leonard: Cool.

   Leonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?

   Penny: Yeah, I think so.

   Leonard: All right.

   Penny: What’s wrong?

   Leonard: I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.

   Penny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?

   Leonard: Oh, I know. This might help.

   Penny: Where did you get a ring?

   Leonard: I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny,
   will you marry me?

   Penny: Oh, my God, yes.

   Leonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you
   didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Howard: How you feeling?

   Bernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we’re
   gonna get through this.

   Howard: I’m proud of us.

   Bernadette: Me, too.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where’s my pancakes?!

   Foreign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!

   Bernadette: You were right.

   Howard: Welcome to Team Putz.
