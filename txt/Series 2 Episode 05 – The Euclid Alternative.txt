Series 2 Episode 05 – The Euclid Alternative

   Scene: The apartment. Leonard enters, drops his keys in the
   bowl by the door, then collapses onto the settee. Sheldon
   enters from the bedroom area.

   Sheldon: Good morning, Leonard.

   Leonard: Uh-huh.

   Sheldon: Yeah, we’re going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on
   the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they
   turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a
   good night’s sleep. I don’t like the way Darth Vader stares at
   me.

   Leonard: I’m not going to work.

   Sheldon: Oh, just because your career’s been stagnant for a few
   years, that’s no reason to give up.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I was up all night using the new
   free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.

   Sheldon: Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Then you can drive. Let’s go.

   Leonard: Didn’t I tell you I’d be working nights, and that
   you’d have to make other arrangements.

   Sheldon: You did.

   Leonard: And?

   Sheldon: I didn’t. Let’s go.

   Leonard: Goodnight, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: But how am I going to get to work?

   Leonard: Take the bus.

   Sheldon: I can’t take the bus any more. They don’t have
   seatbelts. And they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat
   with bungee cords.

   Leonard: You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee
   cords?

   Sheldon: I didn’t try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed
   the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.

   Leonard: Oh, you’re a big boy, you’ll figure it out.

   Sheldon: Don’t talk to me like I’m a child. Now, take me to
   return my star wars sheets!

   Scene: Outside Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock)
   Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny…

   Penny (opening door): Sheldon, what is it?

   Sheldon: Leonard’s asleep.

   Penny: Thanks for the update (begins to close door.)

   Sheldon: No, wait. You have to drive me to work.

   Penny: Yeah, uh, I really don’t think I do.

   Sheldon: But I don’t drive, and I can’t take the bus.

   Penny: Yeah, honey, you’ll be fine as long as you don’t do that
   bungee cord thing, okay?

   Sheldon: Penny. Didn’t you recently state that you and I are
   friends?

   Penny: Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.

   Sheldon: Then I hereby invoke what I’m given to understand is
   an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The
   favour.

   Penny: Oh, dear God.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I was interrupting your
   morning prayers. When you’re done, we’ll go.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Inside Penny’s car.

   Sheldon: Thank you for driving me to work.

   Penny: You know this is my day off, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh, good. I’m not keeping you from anything. Your
   check engine light is on.

   Penny: Mm-hmm.

   Sheldon: Typically that’s an indicator. To, you know, check
   your engine.

   Penny: It’s fine, it’s been on for, like, a month.

   Sheldon: Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to,
   you know, check your engine.

   Penny: Sheldon, it’s fine.

   Sheldon: If it were fine, the light wouldn’t be on. That’s why
   the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it’s not
   fine.

   Penny: Uh, maybe the light’s broken.

   Sheldon: Is there a “check the check engine light light”?
   (Penny takes a drink of coffee) O-o-o-oh!

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Studies have shown that performing tasks such as
   eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while
   driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an
   ounce of alcohol.

   Penny: Do you have any alcohol?

   Sheldon: Of course not.

   Penny: Too bad.

   Sheldon: You’re going up Euclid Avenue?

   Penny: Mm-hmm.

   Sheldon: Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.

   Penny: Well, good for Leonard.

   Sheldon: Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has
   speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive
   time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the
   conn. Of course, if you’re not going to slow down for the speed
   bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here’s a fun question.
   Do you know what the most common street name is?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: The answer’s tricky. It’s Second Street. You see,
   you’d think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First
   Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know,
   like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I
   often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with
   brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to
   play one?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: Oh, come on, it’s fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I’ll
   say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts
   with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I’ll start.
   Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y.
   Ooh.  Very clever, that’s a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which
   gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium,
   you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and you’re left
   with Mendelevium, and  there are no more M’s because I believe
   that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so
   congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?

   Penny: How about we just have a little quiet time now?

   Sheldon: All right. Hmm, huh, I’m sorry, I’m finding your
   reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be
   very troubling.

   Penny (Pulling over): Get out.

   Sheldon: Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a
   theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal
   combustion engine, I’m not sure I’m capable of performing
   diagnostics.

   Penny: I said, get out.

   Sheldon: Okay. I’ll give it a shot. (Gets out. Penny drives
   away.)

   Scene: The university cafeteria. Sheldon enters.

   Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, there you are, I’m ready to go home.

   Leonard: I just got here.

   Sheldon: Good, perfect timing.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the
   free-electron laser at night. I can’t drive you for the next
   few weeks.

   Sheldon: No, you said you couldn’t drive me to work, this is
   from work.

   Leonard: Howard, help me out here.

   Howard: No, just for the fun of it, I’m gonna take his side.

   Sheldon: Now, how do you propose I get home?

   Leonard: How did you get here in the first place?

   Sheldon: Penny. But I sense that’s no longer an option.

   Leonard: Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you’re just
   going to have to find someone else to take you home.

   Howard: Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.

   Scene: Howard’s motor scooter. Howard is driving, Sheldon is on
   the back clutching him for dear life and screaming.

   Sheldon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue!
   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

   Scene: Raj’s car.

   Raj: Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?

   Sheldon: We had a difference of opinion.

   Raj: Over what?

   Sheldon: Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the
   record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?

   Raj: I’m taking you home.

   Sheldon: Oh, but I’m not going home. It’s Wednesday, Wednesday
   is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store.
   And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it’s creamy tomato
   soup day, and Radio Shack, there’s a sale on triple-a
   batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my
   Star Wars sheets.

   Raj: I have a better idea.

   Sheldon: You want to go to pottery barn first?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment, she opens the door, Sheldon is stood
   outside with his Star Wars sheets.

   Sheldon: Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? (She closes the
   door) Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the
   sheets.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon enters from the bedroom area.
   Everyone else is present.

   Sheldon: Good morning.

   All: Good morning.

   Leonard: Sheldon, sit down.

   Sheldon: She’s in my spot. Don’t look at me like that,
   everybody knows that my spot.

   Penny: Sheldon, you know  that we care about you.

   Howard: And it’s because we care about you that we’ve decided
   we have to speak up.

   Penny: You’re hurting the people around you, sweetie.

   Leonard: So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep
   it.

   Sheldon: Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But
   I don’t have a problem.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.

   Howard: This madness has to stop.

   Leonard: Penny’s taking you to the DMV, I’m going to bed.

   Sheldon: Why Penny?

   Leonard: Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.

   Penny: All right, come on Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Hold on, I have one condition.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: We have to stop at Pottery Barn.

   Penny: Okay.

   Sheldon: And Radio Shack.

   Penny: Fine.

   Sheldon: And the comic book store.

   Penny: All right! (They leave.)

   Howard: Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. (He leaves.)

   Raj: I like comic books.

   Scene: The DMV.

   Sheldon: I just don’t see why I need a driver’s license, Albert
   Einstein never had a driver’s license.

   Howard: Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn’t make me wet myself at
   40 miles an hour.

   Penny: Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the
   nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn’t you just get a license
   at 16 like everybody else?

   Sheldon: I was otherwise engaged.

   Penny: Doing what?

   Sheldon: Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4
   supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the
   ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using
   modern twistor theory.

   Penny: Well, how ’bout when you were 17?

   DMV Lady (to the person ahead of Sheldon in the queue): Take
   this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the
   bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! (Sheldon
   moves forward) Application?

   Sheldon: I’m actually more of a theorist.

   Howard: The application in your hand, give it to her.

   Sheldon: Oh.

   DMV Lady: Take this to the testing area, put your name at the
   top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back,
   next!

   Sheldon: Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these
   questions.

   DMV Lady: Look at that sign up there.

   Sheldon: Yes?

   DMV Lady: Does it say I give a damn?

   Sheldon: No.

   DMV Lady: That’s because I don’t.

   Sheldon: Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense,
   how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when
   driving? There’s no possible way to answer that, a car length
   is not a standardized unit of measure.

   DMV Lady: Look at the sign.

   Penny: Sheldon, it’s C, just put down C.

   Sheldon: I don’t need your help, Penny.

   DMV Lady: Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!

   Sheldon: No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.

   Howard: Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?

   Sheldon: How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2,
   when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three
   answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when
   covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the
   coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to
   essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source
   of friction.

   DMV Lady: Here’s your learner’s permit. Go away.

   Sheldon: But I’m not done. I have many additional concerns
   about these questions.

   DMV Lady: Don’t make me climb over this counter.

   Penny: Come on, let’s go.

   DMV Lady: Next!

   Sheldon: Aced it.

   Scene: The apartment. Howard is setting up a large kit of high
   tech equipment.

   Howard: Okay, that’s it, let’s boot it up.

   Leonard: Booting.

   Howard: This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from
   something a friend of mine designed for the army.

   Sheldon: Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah,
   behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?

   Howard: I haven’t configured it yet. Let’s see… Bradley tank…
   transport truck…  Batmobile…

   Sheldon: Ooh!

   Leonard: No.

   Howard: Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of
   Pasadena.

   Sheldon (sucking in breath): Hmmmm?

   Howard: What?

   Sheldon: Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more
   often than any other colour. I don’t want any hassles with the
   fuzz.

   Howard: Fine, what colour do you want?

   Sheldon: You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker’s lightsaber,
   before it was digitally remastered?

   Howard: Black it is.

   Leonard: Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the
   ignition and shift into drive.

   Sheldon: I haven’t fastened my seat belt yet.

   Leonard: Okay, fasten your seat belt.

   Sheldon: Click. Now, are there air bags?

   Leonard: You don’t need air bags.

   Sheldon: What if a simulated van rear-ends me?

   Penny: I’ll hit you in the face with a pillow.

   Leonard: Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into
   traffic.

   (General panic)

   Penny: Oh.

   Leonard: Oh.

   Howard: Oh.

   Leonard: Watch out.

   Howard: Oh God!

   Leonard: Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!

   Penny: Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!

   (Sounds of car crashing. Penny hits Sheldon in face with
   pillow.)

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Scene: The same, only Sheldon and Leonard are present. Sheldon
   is practicing. There are sounds of squealing tyres and brakes
   and general panic and mayhem.

   Sheldon: Sorry… excuse me… my bad… student driver…

   Leonard: How did you manage to get on the second floor of the
   Glendale galleria?

   Sheldon: I don’t know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed
   my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.

   Leonard: Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again
   tomorrow.

   Sheldon: No. I quit. (Stands up. There is more sound of
   crashing and panic, then animal noises.)

   Leonard: Aw, the pet store?

   Sheldon: Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it’s
   amazingly detailed.

   Leonard: So wait,you’re just gonna give up?

   Sheldon: No, I’m not giving up, I never give up.

   Leonard: So what is it you’re doing?

   Sheldon: I’m transcending the situation. I’m clearly too
   evolved for driving.

   Leonard: What does that mean?

   Sheldon: Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and
   lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for
   someone of my size?

   Leonard: I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not…
   not that.

   Sheldon: Well, those are indicators that I’m farther along the
   evolutionary scale than the average human.

   Leonard: No kidding.

   Sheldon: Well, no, no, I’m not going to go so far as to say
   that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a
   Homo Novus, if you will, no, that’s for anthropologists to
   decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the
   plebeian task of driving is because I’m not meant to.

   Leonard: Yes, you are, you’re meant to learn how to drive.
   Please learn how to drive!

   Sheldon: No, no. Leonard, I’m meant for greater things, like
   unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when
   it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.

   Leonard: It’s never safe.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, I know that now.

   Leonard: Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how
   does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow
   morning?

   Sheldon: Homo Novus doesn’t know.

   Leonard: Well, hang in there, maybe you’ll evolve into
   something with wings.

   Scene: A corridor in the university. Sheldon emerges from his
   office in a shower cap and bathrobe. The others are turning the
   corner.

   Sheldon: Good morning, gentlemen.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Raj: Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I
   don’t know about?

   Leonard: No, he lives here now.

   Howard: Really? Why?

   Leonard: Well, since he won’t take the bus and he’s too evolved
   to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his
   office and shower in the radiation lab until I’m finished with
   my experiment.

   Raj: But you finished your experiment a week ago.

   Leonard: Yep

   Scene: The cafeteria, late at night. Two cleaning ladies enter
   and find a plate with toast crusts.

   Cleaning Lady 1 (in Spanish, subtitles): Oh my God, again?

   Cleaning Lady 2: It must be rats.

   Cleaning Lady 1: Rats don’t make toast and cut off the crust.

   (They are startled by a noise. One of them drops the plate, it
   smashes on the floor. Sheldon is by the drink machine, he is
   wearing a cloak with a hood)

   Sheldon: You saw nothing! (Sweeps hood around himself and
   vanishes through cafeteria door.)
