Series 5 Episode 05 – The Russian Rocket Reaction

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Leonard: It’s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?

   Sheldon: I don’t know. If we’re going to start a fantasy sword
   collection, and I’ve long thought we should, is this really the
   sword to start with?

   Leonard: What did you have in mind?

   Sheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I’d have to go with
   Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.

   Leonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop.

   Sheldon: Fair enough. It’d give you the right to rule a replica
   of England.

   Leonard: Well, they don’t have an Excalibur here, so what do
   you want to do?

   Sheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There’s no weaponry from Lord of
   the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

   Leonard: Just Bilbo Baggins’ sword over there.

   Sheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit’s dagger; wouldn’t we look
   silly? Okay, let’s go for it.

   Stuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.

   Leonard: Yeah. It’s okay, I guess.

   Sheldon: Okay? It’s magnificent.

   Leonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?

   Stuart: Oh, it’s hard to put a price on something that’s a copy
   of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let’s
   say 250?

   Leonard: Oh, that’s pretty steep.

   Stuart: Well, it’s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of
   these bad boys.

   Sheldon: Only 8,000? We’re wasting precious time. Buy it.

   Leonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?

   Stuart: Are you kidding? I’m already giving you the friends and
   family discount.

   Sheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We’re getting the friends and
   family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.

   Leonard: Slow down. Two hundred.

   Sheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the
   discounted price.

   Leonard: Will you shut up?

   Stuart: Tell you what, I’ll go two thirty-five.

   Leonard: Nope. Maybe another time.

   Stuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.

   Sheldon: Take it, take it.

   Leonard: Two hundred.

   Stuart: Man, you’re killing me!

   Sheldon: Killing you? I can’t breathe.

   Stuart: Two ten, and I’m losing money.

   Sheldon: Oh, now, we can’t let him lose money, Leonard. I’m so
   sorry.

   Leonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.

   Stuart: Are you crazy? That helmet’s signed by Robert Downey
   Jr.

   Leonard: So?

   Stuart: Okay, if you’re going to question the importance of an
   actor’s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a
   comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!

   Leonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.

   Stuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week.

   Leonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks.

   Sheldon: I’ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge
   you make up for in street smarts.

   Stuart: You want me to wrap it?

   Leonard: No, it’s okay. I’m gonna stab my friend in the chest.

   Wil Wheaton (entering): Hey, Stuart.

   Stuart: Ah, hey, Wil.

   Sheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton.

   Wil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.

   Sheldon: It’s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword
   collection?

   Wil: No.

   Sheldon: I’m not surprised.

   Stuart: Here’s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover
   that you wanted.

   Wil: Awesome. What do I owe you?

   Stuart: Forty bucks.

   Wil: Good deal.

   Sheldon: Sucker. Didn’t even ask for the friends and family
   discount.

   Wil: Hey, I’m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was
   hoping you would stop by.

   Stuart: Will there be girls there?

   Wil: Yeah, of course.

   Stuart: ‘Cause there wasn’t last time.

   Wil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to
   come by.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Wil: All right, great. Later.

   Sheldon: I see what you’re doing. You accept an invitation to a
   party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we’re
   going to be there, and when we don’t show, he looks the fool.
   Fiendishly clever.

   Leonard: I was actually thinking about going.

   Sheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming
   out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.

   Leonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good
   time.

   Stuart: Oh, great, more guys. It’s gonna be another Wil Wheaton
   sausage-fest.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?

   Sheldon: Possibly.

   Leonard: Can you or can’t you?

   Sheldon: It’s not that simple, Leonard.

   Leonard: It never is, is it?

   Sheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two
   mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go
   to Wil Wheaton’s party, you are simultaneously my friend and
   not my friend. I’m characterizing this phenomenon as
   Schrodinger’s Friendship.

   Leonard: Got it. Can I have my water?

   Sheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.

   Penny: Wait, what is going on?

   Sheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a
   thought experiment…

   Penny: No, no, no, no, I didn’t forget. Um, there’s this cat in
   a box and until you open it, it’s either dead or alive or both.
   Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother’s
   camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was
   all kinds of dead cat in there.

   Amy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that
   defies it. You’re the whole package, aren’t you?

   Howard (arriving): Sorry I’m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA
   picked my team’s design for the deep field space telescope
   that’s going on the International Space Station this spring.

   All: Wow.

   Bernadette: Howie, that’s wonderful! Congratulations!

   Howard: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope
   as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.

   Sheldon: Mohammed Lee.

   Howard: Who’s Mohammed Lee?

   Sheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world,
   Lee, the most common surname. As I didn’t know the answer, I
   thought that gave me a mathematical edge.

   Howard: It’s me, Sheldon. It’s me. I’m going up in space!
   Technically, I’m an astronaut.

   All: Wow, that’s amazing!

   Bernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn’t have a shuttle any
   more. How are you going to get up there?

   Howard: Oh, well, it’s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they
   take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian
   Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just
   sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the
   rocket fuel on the black market.

   Bernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?

   Howard: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by
   the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.

   Leonard: I’d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into
   space is one we all share, and Howard’s making that a reality.
   We’re all very proud of you.

   All: Cheers.

   Sheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichés. You
   sicken me.

   Scene: Bernadette’s car.

   Howard: You’re really quiet. Is everything okay?

   Bernadette: Fine. Just a little tired.

   Howard: I hope not too tired, because I’m feeling particularly
   masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.

   Bernadette: I always catch your drift.

   Howard: All right, well, something’s obviously bugging you.
   What is it?

   Bernadette: I just can’t believe you signed up for the space
   program without even talking to me.

   Howard: Oh, I get it. You’re worried about me. That is so
   sweet. You know, there’s a saying we have at NASA. What makes
   the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.

   Bernadette: Just stop talking, Howard.

   Howard: This isn’t the reaction I expected when I told you I
   was gonna be an astronaut.

   Bernadette: What did you think was going to happen?

   Howard: Honestly? Sex.

   Bernadette: Howard.

   Howard: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour
   it is to be chosen to go into space?

   Bernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the
   decision. We’re supposed to be partners. We’re supposed to be a
   team.

   Howard: I’m sorry. You’re right. Okay, let’s try this again.
   Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us,
   and I’d like to discuss it.

   Bernadette: Okay.

   Howard: I’ve been offered a chance to go up to the
   International Space Station for three weeks. What are your
   thoughts on that?

   Bernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in
   the decision-making process.

   Howard: Hey, we’re a team. So, what do you think?

   Bernadette: No.

   Howard: No?

   Bernadette: No.

   Howard: Well why not?

   Bernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never
   knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home
   alive. It was horrible. And I don’t want to live that way with
   you.

   Howard: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was
   11. We never saw him again.

   Bernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you’re not going to space!

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?

   Sheldon: Don’t talk to me as if nothing’s happened between us.
   And yes, it sure is, buddy.

   Leonard: For God’s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger
   stuff.

   Sheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg’s
   uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you
   are or whether I like you, but not both?

   Leonard: You never stop talking, do you?

   Amy: I don’t understand. What differences does it make if
   Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton’s party?

   Penny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon’s mortal enemy.

   Amy: Mortal enemy?

   Penny: Mm-hmm.

   Amy: Sheldon, I know you’re a bit of a left-handed monkey
   wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?

   Sheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the
   list?

   Penny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.

   Sheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it?
   This’ll just take a moment. It’s on a five and a quarter inch
   floppy.

   Amy: A floppy disk?

   Sheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.

   Amy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?

   All: Oh! Oh, God!

   Sheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton’s
   character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star
   Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear,
   so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But
   he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to
   be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The
   floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control
   at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just
   made the list.

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom.

   Bernadette: Howard?

   Howard: Change your mind about sex? I’m still mad, but I’ll do
   it.

   Bernadette: No, I’ve just been thinking. It doesn’t matter if
   I’m afraid for your safety. I don’t want to be the person who
   stands between you and your dreams.

   Howard: Really?

   Bernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you,
   I will never say another word about it.

   Howard: Thank you.

   Bernadette: I love you.

   Howard: I love you, too. So, sex now?

   Bernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I’ll be
   right back. (Exits)

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Over my dead body my son goes into outer
   space!

   Bernadette: I’m ready.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually
   asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the
   night?

   Howard: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and
   turned my own mother against me.

   Raj: Wow. You’re not only our first astronaut. You’re also the
   first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You’re like a rock
   star.

   Howard: Little bit.

   Leonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.

   Sheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not
   yourself.

   Leonard: Going to Wheaton’s party is not betraying you.

   Sheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil
   always thinks it’s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These
   are the droids you’re looking for.

   Leonard: I’m going to a party. I’m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO
   over to the empire!

   Sheldon: Not yet.

   Raj: So, what’s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going
   to break up?

   Howard: I don’t know. If we’re going to get back together,
   she’s going to have to apologize and accept that I’m a grown
   man who can make his own decisions.

   Raj: Then she’s going to have to convince your mother to let
   you go into space.

   Howard: Obviously.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Bernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can’t
   go to space. He’s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an
   asthma attack from reading an old library book?

   Amy: You’re kidding.

   Penny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out
   handing him that book.

   Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m going to do. I don’t want to
   break up over this.

   Penny: Okay, why don’t you just tell him you made a mistake?

   Bernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad
   guy in this?

   Amy: It’s not for us to judge. We’re just here to provide
   comfort and support while you come to grips with what a
   despicable thing you’ve done.

   Bernadette: Oh, God, you’re right. I took our love and threw it
   under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.

   Penny: Well, that, that’s good. I’m glad you came to that. But
   before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.

   Bernadette: What?

   Penny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to
   marry Howard Wolowitz?

   Bernadette: I do, with all my heart.

   Penny: Got it. Just had to check.

   Amy: He’s great.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: All right, Sheldon, we’re going to Wil’s. This is your
   last chance.

   Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a
   historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were
   friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you’re going to have to
   choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I
   was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from
   Stand By Me that no one remembers.

   Leonard: You want to drive?

   Raj: Sure.

   Leonard: Hey, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.

   Leonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at
   the party.

   Sheldon: Brent Spiner?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: I don’t care.

   Leonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.

   Sheldon: I did, but I think I’ve kind of outgrown Star Trek.
   You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a
   load of hooey.

   Leonard: I’m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, Bernadette’s here!

   Howard: Tell her I’m not home!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of a schmuck play is that? She
   can hear you shouting!

   Bernadette: Can we talk?

   Howard: You can. I have nothing to say.

   Bernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I’m sorry I
   said something to your mother.

   Howard: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my
   back.

   Bernadette: I know. I’m sorry. I got scared.

   Howard: If you’re gonna love me, you’re gonna have to love the
   whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.

   Bernadette: I know.

   Howard: Well, don’t say it if you’re not gonna mean it, ’cause
   I’m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to
   go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man
   sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.

   Bernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the
   Caribbean.

   Howard: Well, those big kids were rocking it.

   Bernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much,
   and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.

   Howard: Really?

   Bernadette: You’re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.

   Howard: Right, right.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not
   leaving this planet!

   Scene: Wil Wheaton’s party.

   Raj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg
   Queen in First Contact?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Raj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!

   Leonard: What are you doing here?

   Sheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying
   as you can be, you’re still my little buddy. I’m not going to
   let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let’s meet
   Brent Spiner and go home.

   Wil: Hey, Sheldon, I’m so glad you made it. I found something I
   think you might like.

   Sheldon: What I’d like is for him to have a more depressing
   home. This is quite lovely.

   Wil: This is for you.

   Sheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action
   figure.

   Wil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a
   convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn’t
   show up.

   Wil: Look at what I wrote.

   Sheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil
   Wheaton.

   Wil: It’s my last one. I want you to have it.

   Sheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!

   Brent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven’t seen one of these in years.
   (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to
   make these things look like they were masturbating?

   Sheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original
   mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close
   personal friend, Wil Wheaton.

   Brent: Sorry, Slim. I’ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk
   of my car. You want me to sign one for you?

   Sheldon: You’ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your
   name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.

   Wil: Don’t worry. It doesn’t take up a whole lot of your time.

   Sheldon: Come on, buddy. Let’s not waste another second on this
   loser. Love your house.

   Leonard: Can we get autographed dolls?

   Brent: Sure. Twenty bucks.

   Leonard: Ten.

   Brent: Eighteen.

   Leonard: Twelve.

   Brent: Sixteen.

   Leonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.

   Brent: Done.
