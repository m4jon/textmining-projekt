Series 2 Episode 13 – The Friendship Algorithm

   Scene: The university cafeteria

   Raj: Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding
   is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.

   Sheldon: First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the
   best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of
   tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is
   extracted from the plant…

   Howard: Hey, I’m thinking of growing a mustache.

   Leonard: Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?

   Sheldon: It is extracted from the plant…

   Howard: I’m not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!

   Raj: Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph’s. He was buying
   tequila.

   Howard: Oh, you’d think a guy like that would have some kind of
   booze lackey.

   Leonard: Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before
   his head explodes.

   Howard: Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca…

   Sheldon: Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant
   Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is
   poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.

   Raj: Feel better now?

   Sheldon: It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean,
   from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised
   you wouldn’t do that anymore!

   Kripke (arriving): Hey Hofstadter!

   Leonard: Hey Kripke.

   Kripke: Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty
   thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults.
   Vewy impwessive!

   Howard: What a jerk.

   Raj: Don’t feel bad Leonard, negative results are still
   results.

   Howard: Even twenty thousand of ’em.

   Leonard: Alright, please don’t cheer me up anymore.

   Howard: C’mon, don’t let him get to you. It’s Kripke.

   Raj: Yeah, he’s a ginormous knob.

   Howard: That’s why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here
   at the cool table.

   Raj: Fo’ shizzle.

   Sheldon: Hey it’s true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills
   that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open
   science grid computer that I need to use to run some
   simulations of structure formation in the early universe.

   Leonard: Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets
   use it are his friends.

   Sheldon: Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend
   him. Kripke!

   Kripke: Yeah?

   Sheldon: What’d you say of the idea of you and I becoming
   friends?

   Kripke: I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your
   fwiend.

   Sheldon: Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from
   someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why
   don’t you take some time to reconsider?

   Kripke: Yeah, I’ll do that.

   Sheldon: Well I think we’re off to a terrific start.

   Credits sequence.


   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go
   right into your spam folder.

   Penny: Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn’t bother me as much as
   the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.

   Leonard: Yeah, I got the same one. And that’s not a bathing
   suit, it’s a tan line.

   Sheldon (on phone): Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I’m leaving
   a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you
   today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef’s
   salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef’s salad is
   kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope
   you enjoyed it. I’m following up on our pending friendship, and
   I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status.
   Sheldon Cooper.

   Penny: What’s up with Ichabod?

   Leonard: Oh he’s trying to make a new friend.

   Penny: Oh really? Well, good for him.

   Leonard: Well, unless he’s makes one out of wood like Gepetto,
   I don’t think it’s gonna happen.

   Penny: Well, how did you guys become friends?

   Leonard: There was a flier on the bulletin board at the
   university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.

   Penny: And you moved in anyway?

   Leonard: I assumed he was joking. You’d be surprised how many
   particle physicists have a whimsical side.

   Penny: Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you
   become friends with them?

   Leonard: I don’t know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring?
   Proximity and valence electrons.

   Penny: Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all
   worked out, right?

   Leonard: I suppose. I do miss whistling though.

   Penny: Oh come on, really? (Leonard whistles)

   Sheldon: First warning.

   Scene: Outside Penny’s door.


   Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock)
   Penny (knock, knock, knock) Penny. This is for you.

   Penny: Hello Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Hi.

   Penny: What is this?

   Sheldon: It’s a questionnaire I devised. I’m having some
   difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I’m doing a
   little research to better understand why my current friends
   like me.

   Penny: Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really
   the best way to figure it out?

   Sheldon: Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum.
   But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring
   your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.

   Penny: Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon
   Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to
   hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?

   Sheldon: I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious
   one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness.
   Why don’t you just go ahead and write that number 1. I’m afraid
   you’re on your own for the rest. It should take you no more
   than 3 hours.

   Penny: Wait! How many questions are on this thing?

   Sheldon: Only 211. Don’t worry, in deference to you, I’ve kept
   them on a high school graduate reading level.

   Penny: Thanks pal.

   Sheldon: You got it, buddy.

   Penny: Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by
   being, I don’t know, pleasant?

   Sheldon: Well that’s certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis.
   May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is reading one of the
   questionnaires. He tuts.

   Sheldon: Your questionnaire, very disappointing.

   Leonard: I answered every question Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You answered the multiple choice questions in a
   pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.

   Leonard: Aw, you picked up on that huh?

   Sheldon: How could I not?

   Leonard: Come on! There’s over 200 questions. And look at some
   of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space
   shuttle is to blank?

   Sheldon: There are a number of acceptable answers, for example,
   C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher.
   And your essay, suggesting that I’d have better luck making
   friends if I wait ’til the Cylons take over? Please.

   Leonard: Hold on. I put some real work into that!

   Sheldon: Yes, well it’s better than what Wolowitz did. He drew
   a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.

   Leonard: It’s kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.

   Sheldon: What hope do I have for establishing new relationships
   given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few
   hours out of their lives to help me?

   Leonard: Sheldon, I’m not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.

   Sheldon: I don’t see how you could.

   Leonard: What I’m trying to say is that, maybe you can’t
   approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.

   Sheldon: What do you mean!?

   Leonard: Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim
   using the internet?

   Sheldon: I did learn how to swim.

   Leonard: On the floor.

   Sheldon: The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest
   in going in the water.

   Leonard: Then why learn how to swim?

   Sheldon: The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future,
   swimming isn’t going to be optional. But you do bring up an
   interesting point. I don’t have to break new ground here, I’m
   sure much of the research already exists.

   Leonard: No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make
   friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet
   people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.

   Sheldon: That’s insane on the face of it. Come on.

   Leonard: Where are we going?

   Sheldon: You’re driving me to the mall. I’m going to acquire a
   book that summarizes the current theories in the field of
   friendmaking.

   Leonard: Why don’t you just lie down on the floor and swim
   there?

   Scene: A bookshop.


   Sheldon: Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.

   Woman in queue: Thank you.

   Sheldon: Family or friend?

   Woman: Family.

   Sheldon: Too bad. If it’d been a friend, I’m available to fill
   the void. (Woman moves away) It’s just as well, she smelled
   like moth balls.

   Leonard: Okay, if you’re gonna start sniffing people, I’m gonna
   go get a hot pretzel.

   Sheldon: Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?

   Bookstore employee: Um, yeah but they’re all for little kids.

   Sheldon: I assume the skills can be extrapolated and
   transferred.

   Employee: Uh, I guess. They’re right over there by the wooden
   train set.

   Sheldon: Oh! I love trains!

   Employee: I bet you do.

   Sheldon (picks up train): Oh my! That’s awfully sticky.
   Alright, let’s see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It’s
   probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the
   Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu
   the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in
   Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and
   their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making
   friends, wouldn’t you agree?

   Little girl: I don’t like birds, they scare me.

   Sheldon: Me too! Most people don’t see it. What are you
   reading?

   Girl: Curious George.

   Sheldon: Oh I do like monkeys!

   Girl: Curious George is a monkey.

   Sheldon: Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe
   sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like
   that?

   Girl: Okay.

   Leonard: Sheldon, what are you doing?

   Sheldon: I’m making friends with this little girl. What’s your
   name?

   Girl: Rebecca.

   Sheldon: Hi Rebecca, I’m your new friend, Sheldon.

   Leonard: No you’re not, let’s go.

   Sheldon: We were really hitting it off.

   Leonard: Don’t look up, there’s cameras.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Raj: I’m curious. In the “How Well Do You Know Sheldon”
   section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?

   Leonard and Howard: Lysine.

   Raj: Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.

   Sheldon: Oh good! You’re just in time. I believe I’ve isolated
   the algorithm for making friends.

   Leonard: Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!

   Howard: Hear him out. If he’s really on to something, we can
   open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.

   Sheldon: See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same
   deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he
   was new at the zoo.

   Raj: Stu the cockatoo?

   Leonard: Yes, he’s new at the zoo.

   Sheldon: It’s a terrific book. I’ve distilled its essence into
   a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.

   Howard: Have you thought about putting him in a crate while
   you’re out of the apartment?

   Sheldon (on phone): Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It
   occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because I
   hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our
   friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together…
   I see. Well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage.
   Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa… I see. No, no, no,
   wait. Don’t hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I
   bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of
   yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of
   yours. Oh no, I’m sorry, I have no desire to get in the water
   until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.

   Leonard: Uh-oh, he’s stuck in an infinite loop.

   Howard: I can fix it.

   Sheldon: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It’s interesting. But isn’t
   ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me
   another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like
   monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang
   on, Kripke. (Checking changes Howard has made to his flowchart)
   A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable
   activity! Howard, that’s brilliant! I’m surprised you saw that.

   Howard: Gee. Why can’t Sheldon make friends?

   Sheldon: Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the
   least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that
   together. Tomorrow. Yes, I’ll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright!
   Time to learn rock climbing.

   Scene: Rock climbing centre. Sheldon and Kripke are watching
   someone descend the practice wall.

   Sheldon: You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me
   and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while
   you drink.

   Kripke: Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.

   Sheldon: This appears significantly more monolithic than it did
   on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use
   bones as weapeons.

   Kripke: You afwaid of heights, Cooper?

   Sheldon: Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling,
   on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you
   say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our
   new-found friendship?

   Kripke: Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids
   climb this.

   Sheldon: Little kid Hominids, perhaps. (To man who attaches him
   to ropes) Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so
   proud.

   Kripke: Let’s go, Cooper.

   Sheldon: Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure.
   Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said
   that’s to be expected. Hey, this isn’t so bad. A bit like
   vertical swimming.

   Kripke: Hey, look at you, Cooper. You’re almost halfway to the
   top.

   Sheldon: I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.

   Kripke:You alwight there, Cooper?

   Sheldon: Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent
   function that’s approaching an asymptote.

   Kripke: Are you saying you’re stuck?

   Sheldon: What part of an inverse tangent function approaching
   an asymptote did you not understand?

   Kripke: Understood all that. I’m not a mowon. Just keep going.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I don’t think I can.

   Kripke: Well, then. Cwimb back down.

   Sheldon: No, that doesn’t seem any more likely.

   Kripke: So what’s the pwan, Cooper?

   Sheldon: Well, it’s not exactly a plan but I think I’m going to
   pass out.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: I’m sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?

   Howard: Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and… (Leonard, Howard and Raj
   whistle “Sweet Georgia Brown” together)

   Leonard: It’s a little thing but you really do miss it.

   Sheldon: Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry
   Kripke, home for dinner.

   Together: Oh…

   Kripke: Hewo to you, too.

   Leonard: How was rock climbing?

   Kripke: He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.

   Sheldon: D-d-d! That’s where I sit.

   Kripke: Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are
   you?

   Howard: How much time you got?

   Leonard: Want some Chinese food?

   Kripke: Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?

   Leonard: In the bathroom.

   Kripke: Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my
   teeth if I’m gonna eat Chinese.

   Penny: Sheldon, are you okay?

   Sheldon: Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it.
   I’ve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which
   brings me to an awkward moment.

   Leonard: What’s that?

   Sheldon: Maintaining five friendships promises to be a
   Herculean task. So, I’m going to have to let one of you go.

   Howard: Me, me. Let it be me.

   Sheldon: Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of
   transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come
   out of the dryer. You are safe.

   Leonard: Can I whistle?

   Sheldon: Don’t be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your
   cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available
   for video games during the Jewish high holidays.

   Howard: Guilty as charged. I’m out.

   Sheldon: No. You, too, are safe.

   Howard: Oh come on. What do I have to do?

   Penny: Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I’m not
   one of you guys. I’m not a scientist. So just…

   Sheldon: Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you’re saying is true,
   but please allow me to continue. Raj, you’re out. The good
   question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to
   an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the
   questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a
   moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?

   Leonard: He had Lysine but changed it.

   Sheldon: Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.

   Kripke: I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are
   open for new food.

   Penny: Eww.

   Kripke: Hewo. How did I walk past you? I’m Bawy.

   Penny: Penny.

   Kripke: Yeah, it’s not a vewy hot name. I’m gonna call your
   Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.

   Howard: Suddenly I’m looking pretty good, huh?

   Sheldon: So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there’s any chance
   you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.

   Kripke: No.

   Sheldon: No? But we’re friends!

   Kripke: I’m sowy. No, my fwiend?

   Sheldon: I’m confused. I was given an understanding that you
   allow your friends time on the machine?

   Kripke: No, that’s wong. There’s an official schedule. I have
   no contwol over it.

   Sheldon: Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an
   exercise in futility. Raj, you’re back in. He likes monkeys.

   Scene: The climbing centre.

   Howard: You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.

   Leonard: I didn’t think he had it in him.

   Raj: He almost made it to the top this time.

   Sheldon is seen dangling from the ropes
