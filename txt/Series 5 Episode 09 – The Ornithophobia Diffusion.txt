Series 5 Episode 09 – The Ornithophobia Diffusion

   Scene: The lobby.

   Penny: Hey.

   Leonard: Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?

   Penny: Yeah. I’ve got eight pounds of salmon that’s about to go
   bad. Do you know how to cook it?

   Leonard: Not really.

   Penny: Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What
   are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?

   Leonard: Star Wars on Blu-ray.

   Penny: Haven’t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?

   Leonard: Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.

   Penny: Oh, Leonard.

   Leonard: I know, it’s high-resolution sadness.

   Penny: Well, I’m going to take myself out to a movie tonight.
   You want to go?

   Leonard: Really? Do we do that?

   Penny: What do you mean?

   Leonard: You know, we haven’t spent time alone together since
   we broke up.

   Penny: Oh, it’s not a date, Leonard. It’s just a man and a
   woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.

   Leonard: Sounds like most of my dates.

   Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they
   approach): Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!

   Penny: What is that about?

   Leonard: Well, he’s smart and crazy enough, he may have
   actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the
   window.)

   Sheldon: Shoo, shoo! Be gone!

   Leonard: What the hell is going on?

   Sheldon: There’s a bird outside the window, and he won’t go
   away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or
   seeds here. Shoo, shoo.

   Penny: Really? On top of everything else, you’re afraid of
   birds?

   Sheldon: It’s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be
   recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be
   required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is
   unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.

   Penny: So movies, yes or no?

   Leonard: Movies, yes.

   Penny: Great. I’ll see you later. And remember, he’s more
   afraid of you than you are of him.

   Sheldon: That doesn’t help.

   Penny: No, I was talking to the bird.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock,
   knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird.

   Leonard: Sheldon, just ignore him.

   Sheldon: Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls
   curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I’ll just get along
   with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It’s
   going to be a long night.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away
   making cat noises.

   Leonard: The bird’s still there?

   Sheldon: Quick, what does a hawk sound like?

   Leonard: I don’t know. Scree-scree.

   Sheldon: Please, that’s a seagull. If you’re not going to help,
   don’t help.

   Leonard: Sorry. Do you think I’m overdressed?

   Sheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes.
   If you’re playing Vegas, I’d add sequins.

   Leonard: I’m going to the movies with Penny. I don’t want her
   to think that I think it’s a date.

   Sheldon: Do you think it’s a date?

   Leonard: No, but she might think I think it’s a date even
   though I don’t.

   Sheldon: Or you might think she thinks you think it’s a date
   even though she doesn’t.

   Leonard: Are we overthinking this?

   Sheldon: Not at all.

   Leonard: You’re right. I’m fine. I’m wearing this.

   Sheldon: Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer
   and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello.
   This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I’m at 2311 North Robles
   Avenue. Yeah, I’d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A
   blue jay. I’m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don’t understand
   the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my
   home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt
   that there are things that you’re frightened of. Being stuck in
   a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you
   because you’re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or
   spiders? Don’t you think I tried making cat noises?

   Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap): Too
   casual?

   Sheldon: For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of
   passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can,
   you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture
   of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.)
   What am I thinking? Whiskers!

   Scene: The cinema.

   Penny: Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer
   Aniston movie.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah, sure. There’s also an amazing documentary
   about building a dam on river in South America.

   Penny: Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer
   Aniston, and she’s not building a dam.

   Leonard: Can’t argue with that. I’ll get the tickets.

   Penny: Okay.

   Leonard: Actually, you know what? I think it’s about time I
   pick a movie we see.

   Penny: You pick plenty of movies.

   Leonard: No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An
   hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman
   turns around and realizes love was here all along.

   Penny: But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten
   minutes.

   Leonard: I hate those movies.

   Penny: No, you don’t.

   Leonard: Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you
   wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I
   can’t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both
   bored and aroused.

   Penny: Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you
   pretend to like things just to have sex with me?

   Leonard: All the time.

   Penny: You’re kidding.

   Leonard: Does this sound familiar? I’d love to go shoe shopping
   with you. Hiking? It’s great. It’s two a.m., of course I want
   to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who
   wouldn’t?

   Penny: Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex
   anyway.

   Leonard: Really? You would have slept with me after a
   three-hour documentary on dams?

   Penny: No. No woman would.

   Leonard: See? Now, that’s the great thing. We’re out as
   friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let’s go
   learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental
   bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.

   Penny: All right, fine.

   Leonard: Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.

   Howard: I’m pushing play.

   Sheldon: A minute.

   Howard: If we don’t start soon, George Lucas is going to change
   it again.

   Sheldon: This would go a lot faster if you put your trade
   school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency
   tone generator.

   Howard: I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.

   Sheldon: Yeah, but you’ve got a can-do attitude and that’s
   what’s important.

   Raj: I really don’t get your problem with birds.

   Sheldon: The question you should be asking is what is their
   problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my
   stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.

   Raj: Hummingbirds are pretty.

   Sheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.

   Raj: Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I
   go back and forth.

   Sheldon: Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a
   tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of
   my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat
   ass. Need I go on?

   Raj: Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.

   Howard: All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.

   Sheldon: It’s not a death ray. It’s just a little ultrasonic
   blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I
   wouldn’t be living here. I’d be in my lair enjoying the money
   the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All
   right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows
   shatter. The bird doesn’t move.)

   Raj: That is one tough birdie.

   Scene: A bar.

   Leonard: Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up
   when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.

   Penny: No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I
   can’t.

   Leonard: I’m going to get some fries. You want anything?

   Penny: Uh, no, thanks.

   Leonard: Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you
   eat half my fries.

   Penny: I just eat the little crispy ones you don’t like.

   Leonard: No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they’re
   gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?

   Penny: To get sex.

   Leonard: Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would
   you like anything?

   Penny: All right, I’d like an order of fries.

   Leonard: Great. That’ll be five dollars. I am having the best
   time. I’m so glad you suggested we do this.

   Penny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her): Oh,
   sorry.

   Man: No problem.

   Penny: What you writing there?

   Man: A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex
   and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.

   Penny: I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.

   Man: It’s a working title.

   Penny: Oh.

   Man: I’m Kevin.

   Penny: Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.

   Kevin: I’ll let you get back to your date.

   Penny: Oh, no, no. This isn’t a date, no. Right?

   Leonard: Uh, right.

   Penny: So have you written anything I might have seen?

   Kevin: That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: This is ridiculous. I’m a grown man from Texas. This
   isn’t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It’s just a
   blue jay. (Opens window) That’s a pretty big blue jay. (Closes
   window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet
   and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo!
   Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the
   apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his
   place) No!

   Scene: The bar.

   Penny (to Kevin): So it is an amazing documentary. They need
   the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to
   preserve the environment.

   Leonard: You’re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over
   here?

   Penny: Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?

   Kevin: No problem.

   Penny: What’s up?

   Leonard: I know what you’re doing.

   Penny: What am I doing?

   Leonard: You’re going out of your way to talk to that guy
   because I said we weren’t on a date.

   Penny: No, I’m talking to him because he’s cute.

   Leonard: Come on, he’s not that cute.

   Penny: Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little
   hipster glasses.

   Leonard: I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.

   Penny: Yes, but when you’re tall and have great cheekbones,
   you’re doing it ironically.

   Leonard: If that’s so, what if I start talking to a girl?

   Penny: You should.

   Leonard: I’m serious. I’ll do it.

   Penny: Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What
   are you waiting for?

   Leonard: They’re in a group. I’m scared.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?

   Sheldon: You’re biologists. Biology is the study of living
   things. That’s a living thing, get cracking.

   Bernadette: I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies
   brains.

   Amy: Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.

   Sheldon: Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have
   included a varmints and critters class.

   Bernadette: Come back in, Sheldon, he’s not going to hurt you.
   He looks friendly. I think he might be someone’s pet.

   Sheldon: No, Bernadette, don’t be a hero!

   Bernadette: Oh, he’s a sweetie.

   Sheldon: Yes. It’s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush
   him down the toilet.

   Amy: Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact
   with it. Just like you did with the mailman.

   Sheldon: Every year tens of people around the world are killed
   by birds. I’m not going to be another statistic.

   Bernadette: Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come
   on. You can do it. Don’t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the
   bird, you big baby!

   Sheldon: I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.

   Scene: The bar.

   Woman: So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?

   Leonard: Um, let’s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any
   Jennifer Aniston movie.

   Penny: Hey. Sorry I ditched you.

   Leonard: No, it’s fine. You can ditch away.

   Penny: Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let’s
   hang out.

   Leonard: It’s cool. Go back to Kevin.

   Penny: Oh, he had to leave.

   Leonard: Interesting. So now that he’s gone, you want to hang
   out with me.

   Woman: This must be Penny.

   Leonard: Yep.

   Woman: I totally get it.

   Penny: Huh? I’m sorry, get what?

   Leonard: Don’t worry about it. You know, there’s some guys over
   there. You should go talk to them.

   Penny: No, no. I want to know what you told her.

   Leonard: That’s kind of between me and…

   Woman: Laura.

   Leonard: Laura.

   Penny: Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did
   he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?

   Laura: Really?

   Penny: Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.

   Leonard: Hey, pal. You didn’t see me telling Kevin that you
   thought cold wars were only fought in winter.

   Penny: Okay. Then I’ll return the favour, and I won’t tell…

   Laura: Laura.

   Penny: Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.

   Leonard: When you were telling Kevin about your acting career,
   did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local
   production of The Cheesecake Factory?

   Penny: Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?

   Leonard: Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.

   Penny: A… S… Take me home.

   Leonard: Maybe I’m not done hanging out with… (Laura has gone)
   You’re right, it’s getting late.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has the bird on his arm.

   Sheldon: It’s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for
   what? He’s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven’t
   offered you a beverage.

   Bernadette: Oh, it’s just like my grandma with her parrot. And
   after she lost her marbles with her remote control.

   Sheldon: My phone’s on the desk over there. Take a picture of
   us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad,
   and a calendar. If you were a dove, I’d call you Lovey-Dovey.
   Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn’t a moment for strict adherence
   to the literal. You’re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren’t you?

   Amy: Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around
   here.

   Bernadette: I still think he looks like someone’s pet. Maybe we
   should put up posters.

   Sheldon: Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the
   words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We’re going to have so
   much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I
   can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.

   Amy: If you’re keeping him, I’ve got a cage you can borrow. One
   of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his
   neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.

   Sheldon: Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn’t sleep in a cage. No.
   Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I’m going to get
   off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn’t that right, LD?
   (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come
   back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20
   pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He’s gone.

   Amy: I’m sorry, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid
   bird, so I can love you!

   Scene: The stairwell. They ascend without talking.

   Leonard: Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice
   people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in
   all, a pretty magical night.

   Penny: Okay, I’m not innocent in all this, but you basically
   called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.

   Leonard: I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I’m sorry. No, no,
   no, hang on. I really mean it. And it’s not like when we were
   going out, I’d just apologize for everything so we could end up
   in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I’m sorry.

   Penny: All right. Thank you. I’m sorry, too.

   Leonard: Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?

   Penny: Way off.

   Leonard: Maybe we’re not ready to hang out as friends.

   Penny: I don’t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of
   enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking
   the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.

   Leonard: Really?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Leonard: Well, then, I’m putting sex back on the table. What do
   you think about that?

   Penny: Ooh. Maybe I like it.

   Leonard: You do? Because if that’s what you like, I can be that
   guy. I swear, I’ll be anything you want me to be.

   Penny: Good night, Leonard.

   Leonard: I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.

   Sheldon: Mine was great. I’m going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest
   with an egg in it.)
