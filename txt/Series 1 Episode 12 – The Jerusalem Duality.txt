Series 1 Episode 12 – The Jerusalem Duality

   Scene: The University cafeteria.

   Sheldon: Here’s the problem with teleportation.

   Leonard: Lay it on me.

   Sheldon: Assuming the device could be invented which would
   identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one
   location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for
   reassembly, you would not have actually transported the
   individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and
   recreated him in another.

   Leonard: How about that.

   Sheldon: Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because
   the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to
   create a new Sheldon.

   Leonard: Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on
   the old Sheldon?

   Sheldon: No, he would be exactly the same.

   Leonard: That is a problem.

   Sheldon: So, you see it too.

   Dr Gablehouser (arriving): Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper.

   Together: Dr Gablehouser.

   Gablehouser: Gentlemen, I’d like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis
   is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we’re hoping
   to have him do his graduate work here.

   Leonard: Graduate work, very impressive.

   Gablehouser: And he’s only fifteen years old.

   Sheldon: Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.

   Dennis: Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out
   of North Korea.

   Leonard: Advantage Kim.

   Gablehouser: I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around,
   let him see why we’re the best physics research facility in the
   country.

   Dennis: I already know you’re not. You don’t have an open
   science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string
   theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means
   a dead end.

   Dennis: Well, obviously you don’t see it yet, but trust me, you
   will.

   Gablehouser: Dennis, we discussed this, we’re in the process of
   updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our
   research goals, and we’ve agreed to look the other way if you
   want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle
   your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make
   it happen.

   Leonard: Yes sir.

   Sheldon: You can count on us, we’re on it. What the hell do you
   mean, dead end.

   Dennis: I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string
   theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In
   addition… ooh, look, chocolate milk.

   Sheldon: I sense a disturbance in the force.

   Leonard (in a Yoda voice): A bad feeling I have about this,
   mmm-hmmm.

   Credits sequence

   Scene: A corridor.

   Leonard: So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.

   Dennis: A year and a half.

   Leonard: No kidding, you speak English really well.

   Dennis: So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences
   with prepositions.

   Leonard: What are you talking about?

   Dennis: That.

   Sheldon: He’s not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.

   Dennis: Is this part of the tour?

   Sheldon: Nope. Goodbye.

   Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything.

   Sheldon: Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this
   is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.

   Dennis: Looks like you’re doing work in quantum loop
   corrections.

   Sheldon: Keen observation, goodbye.

   Dennis: You see where you went wrong, don’t you?

   Sheldon: Leonard.

   Leonard: Huh, yeah?

   Sheldon: Get him out.

   Leonard: Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the rec centre, they’ve
   got nautilus equipment.

   Dennis: Do I look like I lift weights.

   Leonard: Not heavy ones.

   Dennis: It’s startling to me you haven’t considered a Lorentz
   invariant field theory approach.

   Sheldon: You think I haven’t considered it? You really think I
   haven’t considered it?

   Dennis: Have you considered it?

   Sheldon: Get him out Leonard.

   Leonard: Come on, Dennis, I’ll show you the radiation lab.

   Dennis: Wow, you won the Stephenson award.

   Sheldon: Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it.

   Dennis: Really, how old?

   Sheldon: Fourteen and a half.

   Dennis: You were the youngest person ever to win it.

   Leonard: It’s like looking into an obnoxious little mirror,
   isn’t it?

   Scene: The living room of the apartment.

   Penny (to Raj): Mmm, this is really delicious, isn’t it? (Raj
   looks uncomfortable, then nods.) Still can’t talk to me unless
   you’re drunk, huh? (Shakes head) Oh, sweetie, you are so
   damaged.

   Howard: Hey, I’m damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?

   Penny: Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

   Sheldon (dramatically): Uh-uh-uh.

   Leonard: Something you’d like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.

   Sheldon: Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old,
   and he’s already correcting my work. Today I went from being
   Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to… you know, that other guy.

   Howard: Antonio Salieri?

   Sheldon: Oh, God, now even you’re smarter than me.

   Howard: You know, Sheldon, you don’t have so many friends that
   you can afford to start insulting them.

   Leonard: Just eat, Sheldon, you’ll feel better.

   Sheldon: Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they
   don’t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her
   between the eyes.

   Penny: I’m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?

   Leonard: You can’t let this kid get to you. You always knew
   that someday someone would come along who was younger and
   smarter.

   Sheldon: Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of
   years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because
   he would be a cyborg.

   Penny: So, you’ve got a bit of competition, I really don’t see
   what the big deal is.

   Sheldon: Well of course you don’t, you’ve never excelled at
   anything.

   Penny: I don’t understand, exactly how did he get any friends
   in the first place?

   Howard: We liked Leonard.

   Leonard: Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?

   Sheldon: Yes. That’s what a rational person does when his
   entire life’s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian
   wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his
   body to scientific research, and he waits to die.

   Penny: You know, I’m confused again, is he waiting, or do we
   get to shoot him between the eyes?

   Scene: The same, later that night

   Sheldon: Hey.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Sheldon: I’ve decided you’re right. My career is not over.

   Leonard: Great.

   Sheldon: But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my
   research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus
   on.

   Leonard: Great.

   Sheldon: So I’ve decided, I’m going to collaborate with you.

   Leonard: Great.

   Sheldon: What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about
   it all the time, but I’ve never really paid attention.

   Leonard: Okay, well, right now I’m designing an experiment to
   study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but
   I really don’t need any help.

   Sheldon: Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what’s this here in the
   schematic, is that a laser array?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead
   of helium neon?

   Leonard: It would blow up.

   Sheldon: Are you sure?

   Leonard: Pretty sure.

   Sheldon: Pretty sure’s not very scientific, is this how you
   normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?

   Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you’re going through
   a bit of a career crisis, you’re searching for some other area
   where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell
   you something and I want you to listen carefully.

   Sheldon: Alright.

   Leonard: Go away.

   Sheldon: If you’re concerned about sharing credit with me,
   you’re name can go first… I’m going.

   Scene: Howard’s lab.

   Howard (into phone): It’s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I’m
   looking at it right now. (Pause.) Why would I make that up,
   there’s no ding-dong in it. (Pause.) How are two ding-dongs
   tomorrow going to help me today?

   Sheldon (entering): So, this is engineering, huh?

   Howard (into phone): I’ll talk to you later.

   Sheldon: Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers
   execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello,
   oompah-loompahs of science.

   Howard: Sheldon, what are you doing here?

   Sheldon: I just came by to say hello.

   Howard: I’ve been at this lab for three years, you’ve never
   came by to say hello.

   Sheldon: Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So,
   what are we making today?

   Howard: A small payload support structure for a European
   science experimental package that’s going up on the next space
   shuttle.

   Sheldon: Really, how does it work?

   Howard: When this is done, it will be attached to the payload
   bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.

   Sheldon: Uh, huh. So it’s a shelf?

   Howard: No, you don’t understand, during acceleration it needs
   to stay perfectly level and provide… yeah, okay, it’s a shelf.

   Sheldon: Now, I notice you’re using titanium, did you give any
   consideration to carbon nanotubes, they’re lighter, cheaper and
   half twice the tensile strength.

   Howard: Sheldon, there’s a diploma in my office that says I
   have a masters in engineering.

   Sheldon: And you also have a note from your mother that says I
   love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument
   for titanium over nanotubes.

   Howard: Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Howard: Go away.

   Sheldon: Did Leonard tell you to say that?

   Howard: No, I thought of it all by myself.

   Sheldon: Huh. It can’t be a coincidence. There must be some
   causal link I’m missing.

   Scene: Raj is exiting his office.

   Raj: Go away. (Sheldon exits)

   Sheldon: Curiouser and curiouser.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard (entering): Is he here?

   Leonard: If he were, I wouldn’t be.

   Raj: Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten
   minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software
   that could replace me.

   Leonard: Is that even possible?

   Raj: As it turns out, yes.

   Howard: Something’s got to be done about him, Leonard.

   Leonard: Like what? He’ll never be able to cope with the fact
   that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished
   than he is.

   Raj: Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he
   was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

   Howard: Then our problem would be solved.

   Leonard: Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim?
   I’m not saying no.

   Howard: We don’t have to go that far, there are other means
   available.

   Raj: We can’t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get
   out.

   Howard: The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose
   his focus.

   Leonard: That won’t happen, he’s not interested in anything but
   physics.

   Howard: What about biology?

   Leonard: What?

   Howard: You know, biology? The one thing that can completely
   derail a world class mind.

   Leonard: Howard, he’s fifteen.

   Howard: Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and
   my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

   Raj: She was sleeping with you?

   Howard: No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it
   would be like if she did.

   Sheldon (entering): Oh, good, you’re all here. Look, I’ve
   decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re
   working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than
   a decade, twelve years tops. (They stare at him.) Go away?
   (They nod) Hmm. Could it be me?

   Scene: Outside Penny’s apartment.

   Penny (opening door): Oh, hey guys, what’s up?

   Howard: We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing
   for smart guys.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: Howard, that’s racist, any fifteen year-old girl will
   do the trick. (Penny slams door.)

   Raj: It’s possible she may have misunderstood us.

   Scene: Sheldon’s office. He is making measurements on maps.
   There is a knock on the door.

   Gablehouser (entering): Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?

   Sheldon: No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you’ll
   appreciate this, very exciting.

   Gablehouser: Oh, what are you working on?

   Sheldon: Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel
   Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve
   decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win
   the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I’m going to solve the Middle-East
   Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle
   of the Mexican desert.

   Gablehouser: To what end?

   Sheldon: You know, it’s like the baseball movie, build it and
   they will come.

   Gablehouser: Who will come?

   Sheldon: The Jewish people.

   Gablehouser: What if they don’t come.

   Sheldon: We’ll make it nice, put out a spread.

   Gablehouser: Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we’re having
   a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who’s agreed
   to join us here at the University.

   Sheldon: Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was
   the one. You can see the Matrix, can’t you.

   Gablehouser: Okay, well, uh, obviously you’re very busy with
   your… uh, um, come Dennis. You’ll have to excuse Dr Cooper,
   he’s been under a lot of… um… he’s nuts.

   Sheldon (voice off, sings to a Mexican tune): Ah, la-la-la,
   Hava Nagila. They’ll come, they’ll settle and I’ll win the
   prize…

   Scene: The welcoming party

   Sheldon: I really don’t understand your objections, Professor
   Goldfarb, why wouldn’t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good
   promised land?

   Goldfarb: Go away.

   Sheldon: We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.

   Goldfarb: Please go away.

   Sheldon: Said Pharoah to Moses.

   Gablehouser: Why are all these young women here?

   Leonard: It’s take your daughter to work day.

   Gablehouser: Really, I was not aware of that.

   Raj: Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to
   everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters
   between the ages of 14 and 16.

   Gablehouser: Hm?

   Howard: Smooth.

   Raj: Thank you.

   Gablehouser: There’s the man of the hour.

   Leonard: Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a
   room full of attractive age-appropriate women.

   Howard: All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. (The
   look at Dennis, who is picking his ear.)

   Leonard: Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

   Raj: We need a social catalyst.

   Leonard: Like what? We can’t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.

   Howard: Or can we?

   Leonard: No, we can’t.

   Howard: I don’t think you mean we can’t. I think you mean we
   shouldn’t.

   Sheldon: Hey, Howard. You’re a Jew. If there was another
   wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to
   taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be
   able to wail at it? Okay, it’s definitely me.

   Leonard: Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a
   girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.

   Raj: Okay. How about that one.

   Howard: Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council,
   goes out with jocks, won’t even look at anybody in the gifted
   programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree
   to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you’re in
   the back seat of your mom’s car with your pants off while the
   whole football team laughs at you.

   Raj: Are you crying?

   Howard: No, I have allergies.

   Raj: Okay, uh, how about her?

   Leonard: Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her
   homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat
   White Russians, while you’re the one holding her head out of
   the toilet while she’s puking and telling you she wishes more
   guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you
   wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one
   weekend and she acts like she doesn’t even know you.

   Raj: Okay, so not her either. How about her?

   Howard: Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so
   probably low self-esteem.

   Leonard: I think that’s our girl. One of us should go talk to
   her.

   Raj: I can’t talk to her, you do it.

   Leonard: I can’t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk
   to her.

   Howard: Oh no, she’ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek
   at this.

   Raj: You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five
   minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we’d be
   done.

   Leonard: Well, we’re not in India.

   Raj: Alright, why don’t we do it your way then? We’ll arrange
   for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can
   pathetically moon over her for months on end.

   Leonard: Okay, that was uncalled for.

   Raj: You started it, dude.

   Gablehouser: Could I have everyone’s attention please. What a
   wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should
   happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We’re here to
   welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.

   Sheldon (sarcastically): Welcome Dennis Kim.

   Gablehouser: Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford
   University, he is also the youngest recipient of the
   prestigious Stephenson Award.

   Sheldon: Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!

   Gablehouser: And now, without any further ado, let me introduce
   the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!

   Dennis: What?

   Gablehouser: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your
   upcoming research.

   Dennis: Um, no thanks. I’m going to the mall with Emma.

   Gablehouser: Well, uh, well, uh….

   Leonard: The kid got a girl.

   Raj: Unbelievable.

   Howard: Did anyone see how he did it?

   Sheldon (to Gablehouser): Don’t worry, I’ve got this. Ladies
   and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of
   his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
   for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my
   research will go on uninterrupted, and that social
   relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank
   you.

   Howard: He’s back.

   Leonard: Yeah, mission accomplished.

   Raj: Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on
   his own?

   Howard: I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart
   is the new sexy.

   Leonard: Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still
   smart.

   Raj: Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it’s offputting.

   Howard: Yeah, let’s go with that.

   Scene: The park. The four guys are carrying remote control
   rockets.

   Howard: Unbelievable. Components I built are on the
   International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a
   model rocket in the park.

   Leonard: I don’t know if the ticket was so much for the launch
   as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk
   me, I have a rocket in my pants.”

   Raj: Hey, look at that. (There is a group of youngsters on the
   grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is
   among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown
   paper bag.) It’s Dennis Kim.

   Howard: Wow, I almost didn’t recognise him.

   Raj: You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.
   (Dennis is now snogging the face off Emma)

   Leonard: Yeah, we really ruined his life.

   Sheldon: Screw him, he was weak.
