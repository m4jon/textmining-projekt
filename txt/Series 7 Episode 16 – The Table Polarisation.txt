Series 7 Episode 16 – The Table Polarisation

   Scene: The apartment

   Howard: I’m thinking about growing a goatee.

   Raj: Oh, actually that’s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on
   the chin.

   Leonard: Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up
   here?

   Raj: You mean a moo-stache?

   Leonard: Moo-stache.

   Howard: He said it.

   Raj: Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your
   information, there are four times as many Indians as there are
   Americans, so the way we say it is right.

   Howard: Say what?

   Raj: Moo-stache.

   Leonard: Moo-stache.

   Howard: He said it.

   Bernadette: Guys, you’re being childish.

   Sheldon: Yeah, she’s right. You’re grown men, the kind who are
   perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.

   Amy: Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.

   Penny: Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at an audition.

   Leonard: Oh, I’m sorry.

   Sheldon: You’ll get ’em next time.

   Penny: How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how
   it went?

   Leonard: Sorry. How did it go?

   Penny: Just shut up.

   Raj: Here, you can have your seat.

   Penny: No, no, no, stay there. I’m fine on the floor.

   Bernadette: Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining
   room table?

   Amy: Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.

   Raj: Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The
   pretty white girl’s there ten seconds, and suddenly we’re all
   running to IKEA.

   Sheldon: No one is running anywhere. We’re not getting a dining
   room table.

   Leonard: I know you don’t like change, but it’s not a terrible
   idea.

   Penny: Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not
   get a table?

   Sheldon: Do you want the long answer or the short answer?

   Howard: Hey, how come we never get that option?

   Sheldon: Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic
   system, if the equations describing its behaviour are
   non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to
   a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.

   Penny: Translation?

   Leonard: Waah. I don’t want a table.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room
   table. You want to come with us?

   Sheldon: You know, I’d love to, but, um, I’m too busy falling
   back in love with Windows 98.

   Leonard: Seriously? You haven’t used this desk in years. The
   second I want to get rid of it, you’re up here working?

   Sheldon: I can’t talk right now, I have several thousand
   updates to install.

   Leonard: Are you really gonna sit here all day?

   Sheldon: Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker’s Guide to
   the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his
   home.

   Leonard: If you’ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth
   anyway.

   Sheldon: It’s a made-up story, Leonard, I don’t even know why
   you’re talking about it.

   Leonard: I’m putting all this stuff in storage. We don’t need
   any of it.

   Sheldon: You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in
   here we can live without.

   Leonard: Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.

   Sheldon: Wait. Is this really worth it? We’ve lived together
   for years with nary an argument.

   Leonard: Huh?

   Sheldon: But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we’re
   at each other’s throats.

   Leonard: Nary an argument? Nary?

   Sheldon: Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of
   a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don’t know if I
   won that, but at least he’s upset.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: Check it out.

   Raj: Magic wand TV remote?

   Howard: Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.

   Raj: Did Bernadette think it was cool?

   Howard: Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.

   Raj: Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might
   be my second favorite brown magic wand.

   Howard: Well, that’s the last time I play with that. (Phone
   rings) I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137

   Raj: Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much
   better than watching TV like a muggle.

   Howard: Okay. Thank you. We’ll be in touch. You’re not gonna
   believe this.

   Raj: What’s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What’s going on?

   Howard: That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space
   station.

   Raj: Wow. What did you tell them?

   Howard: I told them I’d be honoured.

   Raj: A second trip to space, I’ll miss you.

   Howard: And I’m gonna miss you, too.

   Raj: And I just want you to know, I’m happy to look in on
   Bernadette while you’re gone.

   Howard: Thank you.

   Raj: And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our
   first born son Howard. I’m just kidding. We’ll name him Dalib,
   after my grandfather.

   Scene: A furniture store.

   Penny: Ooh, this one looks nice.

   Leonard: No. Sheldon doesn’t like reclaimed wood.

   Penny: Why not?

   Leonard: He’s afraid the original owners will come back.

   Penny: Yeah. Well, Sheldon’s not here.

   Leonard: Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out
   with a bone saw and a melon baller, there’s nothing I can do
   about it.

   Penny: All right, sweetie, you’re paying for this table, and
   it’s your apartment, too.

   Leonard: I know, but…

   Penny: No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.

   Leonard: You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we
   watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted
   Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with
   Samwise Gamgee.

   Penny: See? Right there. You’re a grown man, you should be able
   to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn’t, but one
   problem at a time.

   Leonard: You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I’m
   getting it.

   Penny: Really? This one?

   Leonard: That one? Damn right I like that one.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: Hey.

   Howard: Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on
   a rocket.

   Bernadette: Fine. Can I at least shower first?

   Howard: No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no
   take-backs.

   Bernadette: What are you talking about?

   Howard: Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed
   on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back
   up and fix it.

   Bernadette: Wow. Well, what did you say?

   Howard: What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look
   surprised?

   Bernadette: Well, it’s just, after last time, I didn’t think
   you’d ever want to go back.

   Howard: Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my
   life.

   Bernadette: Really? ‘Cause I kind of remember a lot of
   complaining and wishing for it to be over.

   Howard: I think you have me confused with what’s gonna happen
   when you get out of that shower.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Hey, all set. What do you think? There’s plenty of
   room for everybody, a view out the window.

   Sheldon: My spot on the couch has a great view of a window.
   Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It’s called a TV.

   Penny: Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.

   Sheldon: You’re absolutely right. Nope.

   Penny: Well, you can’t say he didn’t give it a fair shot.

   Sheldon: So, when can we get rid of it?

   Leonard: We’re not.

   Sheldon: What about the roommate agreement? It specifically
   states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by
   the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years.
   Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.

   Penny: Come on, that is ridiculous.

   Leonard: She’s right, a committee that important should meet
   more often.

   Penny: That’s not what I’m saying.

   Leonard: Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and
   not letting him run my life?

   Penny: Yes.

   Leonard: That.

   Sheldon: Okay. I think we’ve found the problem here. It’s not
   the table at all. It’s you.

   Penny: Me?

   Leonard: Well, it’s always me, take one for the team.

   Sheldon: I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an
   acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and
   reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy
   genitals.

   Penny: Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?

   Leonard: Fancy sounds like a compliment.

   Penny: Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That’s just
   what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy’s changed you.

   Sheldon: That’s not true.

   Penny: Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of
   touching another human being. Now you’re holding hands, you’re
   going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.

   Sheldon: She told you?

   Penny: Of course she told me, it’s the most interesting thing
   that’s ever happened to her in her entire life.

   Leonard: You’re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact
   on you.

   Sheldon: You’re right. Without realizing it, I’ve allowed that
   woman to alter my personality.

   Leonard: Mm, Sheldon, you didn’t have a personality, you just
   had some shows you liked.

   Sheldon: No. No, I’ve changed. Like the frog who’s put in a pot
   of water that’s heated so gradually he doesn’t realize he’s
   boiling to death.

   Penny: Or you’re the frog who’s been kissed by a princess and
   turned into a prince.

   Leonard: Or you’re just a tall, annoying frog.

   Sheldon: Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.

   Penny: Oh, Sheldon, wait.

   Sheldon: No. You’ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made
   me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.

   Leonard: Well, we should call her.

   Penny: Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it’s Penny. Hey. Just a little
   heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon’s
   breaking up with you.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?
   (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? I’ll get right to the point. I think
   we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your
   finger, and, uh, please don’t cry on my iPad, I didn’t get
   AppleCare.

   Amy: I’m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I’m a
   little surprised you didn’t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your
   life. Where do I sign?

   Sheldon: At the bottom. I must say, I’m relieved you’re not
   making more of a scene out of this.

   Amy: Oh, I’ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has
   nothing to do with me.

   Sheldon: It doesn’t?

   Amy: Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the
   focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our
   relationship. He’s manipulating you like he always does.

   Sheldon: Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?

   Amy: All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I
   wasn’t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your
   apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?

   Sheldon: It is hideous.

   Amy: Well, thankfully, I won’t have to see it, ’cause I won’t
   be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I
   would like to take a survey.

   Sheldon: Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the
   dining room table?

   Amy: Of course I was.

   Sheldon: Wait. How do I know that you’re not manipulating me
   right now?

   Amy: I think if I were manipulating you, you’d be smart enough
   to see it.

   Sheldon: How do I know you’re not saying that as part of the
   manipulation?

   Amy: I think you’d be smart enough to see that, too.

   Sheldon: Okay. I’m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just
   had to be sure.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Raj: It’s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back
   up.

   Bermadette: Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?

   Raj: Course.

   Bernadette: He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an
   awful wife if I don’t think he should do it again?

   Raj: Not at all. He’s forgotten how miserable he was the entire
   time he was up there. It’s like me in those moments when I miss
   India.

   Bernadette: So you’ll talk to him?

   Raj: Why me?

   Bernadette: Well, I’m his wife, I don’t want to ruin it for
   him.

   Raj: That’s the dynamic, I’m the fun one, you’re the buzzkill.

   Bernadette: Since when am I the buzzkill?

   Raj: Do you think this is cool?

   Bernadette: No, I think it’s stupid.

   Raj: Aha.

   Bernadette: You’re right, it’s great.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Leonard: Oh, hey. You guys didn’t break up.

   Sheldon: No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that
   you were only trying to manipulate me.

   Amy: Which you also figured out by yourself.

   Sheldon: Which I also figured out by myself.

   Penny: Well, I’m glad you’re still together.

   Sheldon: Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our
   relationship.

   Amy: Which is stronger than ever.

   Sheldon: Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying
   to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.

   Howard: But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the
   spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only
   exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch.
   Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was
   good.

   Sheldon: Um.

   Amy: You don’t need to explain yourself to him.

   Sheldon: I don’t need to explain myself to you!

   Amy: You’re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.

   Sheldon: Keep the table. We don’t use that space.

   Amy: Damn it, I got cocky.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: Hey, Bernie. I’m home. Hello.

   Bernadette: Hi, honey.

   Howard: What’s going on?

   Bernadette: Maybe you should have a seat.

   Howard: Um, okay. I know my mom’s not dead, there’d be
   balloons.

   Raj: Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish
   you.

   Mike Rostenkowski: Well, I wouldn’t…

   Bernadette: Daddy.

   Mike R: You’re great.

   Mike Massimino (on skype): Can I say something?

   Raj: Oh, of course.

   Mike M: Hey, Fruit Loops.

   Howard: Massimino? Why are you here?

   Mike M: Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to
   the space station, and as someone who’s been there with you,
   well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?

   Howard: Sure.

   Mike M: The stuff you have is wrong.

   Howard: You don’t think I did a good job up there?

   Mike M: You did a fine job. It’s just, you were scared and
   miserable the whole time.

   Bernadette: I think what we’re all trying to say is, you don’t
   seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for
   you.

   Raj: Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.

   Mike R: Like a woman. Great analogy.

   Howard: Fine, maybe I was a little scared.

   Mike M: You peed in your space suit.

   Howard: You’re supposed to do that.

   Mike M: Not during the fitting.

   Mike R: Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do
   before you went up last time?

   Howard: Hang on. That was just me joking around.

   Mike R: You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.

   Howard: Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out
   of this. Shoot me in the foot.

   Bernadette: Don’t forget all the other astronauts picking on
   you.

   Raj: And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back
   in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.

   Mike M: That was funny.

   Howard: Okay, so I wasn’t exactly John Glenn up there, but I’ve
   changed. I’m a different man now. Yeah, and I’m a little
   insulted that you guys don’t think I can handle it.

   Mike M: You know you’re gonna have to go through survival
   training again.

   Howard: Really?

   Scene: A doctor’s surgery.

   Howard: You’ve got to get me out of this.

   Doctor: What do you want me to do? You’re perfectly healthy.

   Howard: Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher.
   just give me a second. (Dials phone)

   Mrs Wolowitz (on phone): Hello?

   Howard: Hi, Ma. How are you?

   Mrs Wolowitz: How I am is not dead, but you wouldn’t know that,
   because you don’t love me enough to pick up the phone.

   Howard: Go, go, go.

   Mrs Wolowitz: For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub
   and drowned. That’s what happened to your Aunt Ida.

   Doctor: Wow.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Howard, I’m so sorry your blood pressure was off the
   charts.

   Howard: Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge
   the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.

   Leonard: But the mission wouldn’t be for at least a year. Isn’t
   that enough time to get your blood pressure under…

   Howard: Look, my blood pressure’s too high, okay? Drop it.

   Penny: You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months,
   she…

   Howard: Went to space? I don’t think so. Now, pass the soy
   sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.

   Penny: Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?

   Bernadette: Yeah, it’s fun up here.

   Leonard: So why are you trying to ruin it?

   Sheldon: No, thanks. We’re fine. I mean, if you people want to
   eat at the table, then that’s what you should do. I like eating
   down here because this is how we’ve always done things. But if
   those days are gone, they’re gone. It just makes me sad.

   Bernadette: Now I feel bad.

   Leonard: Oh, don’t anthropomorphize him, he’s got big eyes, but
   his feelings are not like ours.

   Bernadette: No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two
   groups.

   Leonard: Well, it’s not silly if you think of that group as
   being led by a big, evil baby.

   Bernadette: Look at Amy down there. Should we go?

   Penny: Yeah, let’s go.

   Leonard: But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should
   stand up to him.

   Penny: Forget it, Leonard. It’s over.

   Leonard: Fine.

   Amy: Rajesh?

   Raj: Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I’m
   staying right here.

   Bernadette: Come on, Raj, it’s not the same without you.

   Raj: Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.

   Howard: You mean tings like moo-stache?

   Sheldon: Well, isn’t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.
