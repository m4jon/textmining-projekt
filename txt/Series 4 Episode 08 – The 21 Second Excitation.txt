Series 4 Episode 08 – The 21 Second Excitation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology
   professor get that good with a whip?

   Howard: Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That’s
   how I learned.

   Leonard: I can’t believe you’ve never seen Raiders of the Lost
   Ark.

   Penny: And I can’t believe you’ve never read Eat, Pray, Love.

   Leonard: When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A
   Giant Boulder, I’ll read it.

   Howard (after Raj whispers to him): I don’t care if Eat, Pray,
   Love changed your life, I’m not reading it.

   Penny: You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.

   Sheldon: That’s the work of noted Hollywood costume designer
   Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black
   jacket in Michael Jackson’s Thriller video, which I’ve never
   viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in
   choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it’s really
   scary.

   Leonard: Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary
   track?

   Sheldon: There’s no switch. Just listen and learn.

   Howard: Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with
   us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.

   Penny: Well, I’m watching it now. Why would I want to see it
   again on Friday?

   Sheldon: Because the print they’re showing on Friday has an
   additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.

   Penny: What, 21 seconds? That’ll be like seeing a whole new
   movie!

   Leonard: Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine
   controversy.

   Sheldon: Did Leonard? I’m no expert, but I believe what we just
   heard from Penny was sarcasm. (She indicates it was) Oh, good.
   I’m eight for 26 this month.

   Penny: Yeah, I think I’ll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra
   21 seconds.

   Leonard: Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a
   cool thing, we’d still be together.

   Penny: Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn’t.

   Howard: Uh-huh. I’m guessing 21 seconds had something to do
   with that, too.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.

   Sheldon: May I point out to you all that the screening is first
   come, first served?

   Leonard: Relax, it’s five o’clock. The movie doesn’t start till
   midnight.

   Sheldon: Another way of saying that is the movie starts at
   midnight, and it’s already five o’clock. Let’s go.

   Howard: You know, if we miss it, we’ll have the fun of
   listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.

   Sheldon: See? Howard’s on my side.

   Howard: Actually, I’m not. I’m using sarcasm to mock you.

   Sheldon: Drat. Now I’m 8 for 27.

   Leonard: Don’t worry, Sheldon. We’ll be fine.

   Sheldon: What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in
   line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star
   Trek: Nemesis?

   Leonard: Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you
   napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when
   he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn’t wake up to vouch
   for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

   Sheldon: But how were our seats?

   Leonard: Excellent.

   Sheldon: I rest my case. Amy, don’t you agree we should leave
   now and get in line?

   Amy: Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I
   believe I’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with
   your friends from time to time.

   Sheldon: Shrewd.

   Amy: Leonard, you’re right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive
   late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get
   in at all.

   Leonard: Thank you, Amy.

   Amy: See? It’s working.

   Bernadette: Knock-knock.

   Howard: Who’s there?

   Bernadette: Olive.

   Howard: Olive you, too.

   Leonard: Guys, that’s really starting to get old.

   Howard: Knock-knock.

   Leonard: Who’s there?

   Howard: I have a girlfriend and you don’t.

   Leonard: Hysterical!

   Sheldon: Wait, now, we don’t know that yet. He isn’t finished.
   I have a girlfriend and you don’t who?

   Howard: So. Are you sure you don’t want to come with us to
   Raiders?

   Bernadette: Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me
   too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating
   bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are
   having a girls’ night tonight.

   Amy: Girls’ night? What does that entail?

   Bernadette: Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share
   girl talk.

   Amy: I’m a girl.

   Bernadette: Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I’ll ask Penny.

   Amy: No need. Penny and I are very close.

   Bernadette: You are?

   Amy: Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny.
   Bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night.

   Penny: Yeah?

   Amy: I’m a girl.

   Penny: Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and
   Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies
   with Sheldon and the guys.

   Amy: Yes, but they’re not girls. I’m a girl.

   Penny: Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.

   Amy: What’s the dress code?

   Penny: Uh, just wear something comfortable.

   Amy: All right. I’ll have to go shopping.

   Sheldon: Knock-knock.

   Leonard: Who‘s there?

   Sheldon: Hugh.

   Leonard: Hugh who?

   Sheldon: Hugh people need to listen to me. It’s time to get in
   line for the movie. And that’s how you tell a knock-knock joke.

   Scene: The movie theatre. The line is incredibly long.

   Sheldon: Under normal circumstances I’d say, I told you so. But
   as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency
   already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be
   replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly.

   Howard: Ooh. Can’t wait for that to start.

   Sheldon: I informed you thusly.

   Raj: Eight for 28.

   Sheldon: This is where we could have been if we hadn’t stopped
   for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali
   hadn’t ordered dessert.

   Raj: Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.

   Sheldon: And here’s where we are. The runts in a large litter,
   unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.

   Leonard: So I guess it’s a good thing we stopped for dinner.

   Raj: You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray,
   Love teaches us–

   Howard: Oh, shut up.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy: So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an
   unusually firm cervix.

   Penny: You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn’t just
   have to be about our lady parts.

   Amy: Shame. ‘Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.

   Bernadette: Penny, your nails look great.

   Penny: Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It’s in a
   woman’s basement. I think it’s a front

   for human trafficking, but they do a really good job.

   Amy: A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus
   that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well
   don’t tell me that’s not girl talk.

   Penny: So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?

   Bernadette: Or we could just stay here.

   Amy: Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after
   tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF,
   if you prefer. Which I don’t.

   Penny: All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.

   Bernadette: Gee, I don’t know if I should drink more. I have to
   drive home, and I’ve got enough trouble seeing over the
   dashboard as it is.

   Penny: That’s okay. Y ou can just sleep here.

   Amy: Oh, good, a slumber party! We’ll do makeovers, initiate
   phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our
   frilly nighties!

   Penny: Oh, gosh, Amy. I don’t know if I would call this an
   actual slumber party.

   Amy: Well, that’s disappointing. I’ve always wanted to be
   invited to a slumber party.

   Bernadette: Oh, you never were?

   Penny: Not even when you were a kid?

   Amy: Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I
   shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn’t make it
   through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun.

   Penny: Okay. Well, I guess we’re having a slumber party. Oh!

   Amy: Pillow fight!

   Scene: The movie line.

   Leonard: Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running
   to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a
   Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle.

   Howard: Too bad you don’t have a stadium pal like me.

   Leonard: What’s a stadium pal?

   Howard: Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom
   problem, and it keeps your calf warm.

   Raj: Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given
   the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might
   not get seats.

   Sheldon: What did he say?

   Leonard: Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.

   Sheldon: We might not get seats?

   Leonard: It’s fine, it’s fine. Go back to sleep.

   Sheldon: Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.

   Leonard: Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You’re peeing, aren’t
   you?

   Wil Wheaton: Hey, look who’s here! Hey, buddies!

   Sheldon: Well, if it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of
   the Star Trek universe.

   Wil: Mee-sa think that very funny.

   Sheldon: Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the
   line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.

   Theatre Staff: Wil Wheaton.

   Wil: Yeah.

   Theatre Staff: I’m a big fan.

   Sheldon: Of what? Poorly executed beards?

   Wil: Do you think you could get me and my friends into the
   movie? We got here a little late.

   Theatre Staff: No problem. Come on, I’ll hook you up.

   Wil: Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.

   Sheldon: This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be
   no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek
   conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.

   Leonard: Calm down, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: I will not calm down. This affront to justice and
   decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once
   said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!

   Leonard: Had to wake him up from his nap, didn’t you?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Bernadette: You know what I really love about Howard? His chest
   hair.

   Penny: Howard has a hairy chest?

   Bernadette: No, just the one. But it’s really long.

   Penny: Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you
   think?

   Amy: My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.

   Scene: The movie line.

   Raj: Oh, oh, uh, looks like they’re getting ready to let people
   in.

   Sheldon: Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats
   in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.

   Leonard: Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it’s only
   going to upset you.

   Sheldon: I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter
   existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the
   tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant?
   Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but
   excuse me. (On phone) Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time
   to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All
   right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I’m a total buttwad.
   Why are you laughing? Hello?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.

   Amy: I’m not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all
   right. Next on Wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities,
   Truth or Dare.

   Penny: Okay, it’s your game. You go first.

   Amy: Hang on. I’m familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems
   fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?

   Bernadette: Truth.

   Amy: All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order
   to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?

   Bernadette: Um.

   Amy: Remember, you have to answer honestly.

   Penny: Wait. No, Amy, you’re supposed to ask her something
   personal or embarrassing.

   Amy: Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?

   Scene: The movie line.

   Sheldon: Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the
   gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea,
   choking to death, woot, woot.

   Theatre staff: Guys, I am sorry. We are full up.

   Sheldon: No!

   Theatre staff: We’re full up.

   Leonard: We really want to see this. Is there anything you can
   do?

   Theatre staff: Sorry. Fire regulations. Should’ve gotten here
   earlier.

   Sheldon: This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a
   petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his
   lackeys get in and we don’t.

   Theatre staff: ‘Cause I’m the petty functionary with the
   clipboard, bitch.

   Howard: I guess that’s that. Let’s go home.

   Sheldon: You know what? I’m going back to I told you so. I told
   you so.

   Raj: We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock
   movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always
   brings it.

   Sheldon: Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round.

   Howard: I guess we’d better go after him.

   Leonard: Short Round?

   Raj: Indy’s young sidekick from Temple of Doom.

   Leonard: Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?

   Raj: You’re right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy: And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is
   scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the
   rowte.”

   Penny: What the hell was that?

   Amy: Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller’s
   Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have
   been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had
   worn socks.

   Bernadette: I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part
   where he kisses her nether yea.

   Amy: You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea
   meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be
   kissing it.

   Bernadette: Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?

   Penny: Truth.

   Bernadette: Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much
   even though you broke up with him?

   Amy: Oh, that’s an excellent question. For two people who claim
   to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of
   time in each other’s company.

   Bernadette: Yeah.

   Penny: Dare.

   Amy: I don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto
   option change.

   Bernadette: Yeah.

   Penny: Okay, look, just because we’re not seeing each other
   anymore doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I mean, Leonard’s a
   great guy.

   Amy: Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?

   Penny: I don’t know. He got really serious, and I wasn’t ready
   for it.

   Amy: Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you
   become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because
   another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a
   great guy?

   Penny: You can only ask one question.

   Amy and Bernadette together: That one.

   Penny: You know what, I don’t want to play anymore.

   Amy: Well, I’m not sure how this is scored, but I believe we
   may have won.

   Scene: The movie theatre.

   Leonard: Sheldon? Sheldon?

   Howard: Where did he go? (Raj whistles) We’re looking for
   Sheldon, not Marmaduke.

   Sheldon: You whistled?

   Leonard: What is that?

   Sheldon: Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds.
   If I can’t see it, no one else can see it.

   Leonard: Sheldon, this is crazy.

   Sheldon: No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.

   Leonard: Listen to me. You are over-tired. You’re not thinking
   right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.

   Sheldon: Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it’s
   Lee, but I prefer Trouble.

   Wil Wheaton: Oh, look who they let in.

   Sheldon: Don’t worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.
   Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!

   Howard: Come on, Short Round.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Scene: Outside the movie theatre.

   Sheldon: Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!

   Raj: Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!

   Howard: Let’s see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your
   leg.

   Wil: He’s got the movie! Get him!

   Sheldon: Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Bernadette: She’s been in there a long time.

   Amy: Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should
   try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party
   activity.

   Bernadette: Ooh, like what?

   Amy: Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests
   often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.

   Bernadette: Where exactly on the Internet have you been
   looking?

   Amy: Penny?

   Penny: Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I’m sorry I got so upset. I
   just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What
   are you doing?

   Amy: Don’t worry. I’ll avoid the nether yea.

   Bernadette: I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
