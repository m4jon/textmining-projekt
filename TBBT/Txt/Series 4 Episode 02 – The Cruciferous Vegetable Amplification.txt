Series 4 Episode 02 – The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has a series of whiteboards
   across the room.

   Leonard: Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch
   the roadrunner?

   Sheldon: The humorous implication being that I am Wile E.
   Coyote?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device
   that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m
   going to die.

   Leonard: A lot of people are working on that research. So what
   is all this?

   Sheldon: My family history factoring in longevity, propensity
   for disease, et cetera.

   Leonard: Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB.
   What’s KBB?

   Sheldon: Killed by badger.

   Leonard: How’s that?

   Sheldon: It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s
   a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those
   were the last words he ever spoke to us.

   Leonard: I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers
   being hereditary.

   Sheldon: Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded
   genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded
   against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that
   I don’t share that flawed DNA?

   Leonard: You can always get a badger and find out.

   Sheldon: But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl
   factor, at best I have 60 years left.

   Leonard: That long, huh?

   Sheldon: 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.

   Leonard: What’s there?

   Sheldon: The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man
   will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and
   achieve immortality.

   Leonard: So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some
   sort of freakish self-aware robot?

   Sheldon: By this much.

   Leonard: Tough break. You want eggs?

   Sheldon: You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much,
   the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus.

   Leonard: What’s a dogapus?

   Sheldon: A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best
   friend.

   Leonard: Is somebody working on that?

   Sheldon: I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my
   300th birthday.

   Leonard: Wait a minute. You hate dogs.

   Sheldon: A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can
   hate that.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: What do we owe you?

   Leonard: It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.

   Howard: Here you go.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: Never mind. I got it.

   Penny: Oh, you wanted me to pay.

   Leonard: It’s no big deal.

   Penny: No, no, no, no. You’re right. We’re not going out
   anymore, I should pay for myself. (After Raj whispers to
   Howard, and Howard laughs) What?

   Howard: He said if he had woman parts, he’d eat for free the
   rest of his life.

   Penny: Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to talk to yourself. I’m
   a little low on cash.

   Leonard: Hmm? How much you got?

   Penny: Nothing.

   Leonard: How can you walk around with no money?

   Penny: I’m cute. I get by.

   Leonard: It’s okay, you can owe me.

   Penny: Okay.

   Leonard: Sheldon, six bucks.

   Sheldon: No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.

   Penny: But it’s Thursday. Thursday’s pizza night.

   Sheldon: Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable
   Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts.

   Howard: Really? You’re changing the Sheldonian calendar?

   Sheldon: It’s a small price to pay.

   Penny: For what?

   Leonard: No, no, don’t ask.

   Penny: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

   Sheldon: In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness
   with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.

   Penny: Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?

   Sheldon: Correct.

   Penny: So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?

   Sheldon: Essentially, yes.

   Penny: Okay, here’s my question. Didn’t you already do that?

   Sheldon: Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin
   an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular
   system. AKA jogging.

   Penny: Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?

   Sheldon: Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry
   chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher
   determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.

   Howard (after Raj whispers to him): You’re right, Penny jogs.
   Maybe you guys can run together.

   Sheldon: That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will
   create the illusion of time going faster.

   Penny: No, it won’t. Um, how does he know I jog?

   Howard: Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered
   binoculars.

   Penny: Oh, my God, that is so creepy!

   Howard: I know! (Raj whispers to him) And he says he’s not
   gonna stop. (Raj whispers to him urgently) Then see a shrink
   and figure out how to talk to women.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom

   Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock)
   U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.

   Leonard: What the hell? What’s the matter?

   Sheldon: I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right
   abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have
   cholera.

   Leonard: There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer,
   when there was no malaria in Pasadena.

   Sheldon: Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick
   Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of
   likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot
   tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.

   Leonard: When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum
   blossoms?

   Sheldon: It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves
   sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a
   less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!

   Leonard: Have you had your appendix out?

   Sheldon: I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?

   Leonard: Let’s get you to the hospital.

   Sheldon: So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I
   make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my
   appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose
   of the appendix, Leonard?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.

   Leonard: Funny how things work out, isn’t it?

   Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst! (Loud sound of
   farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels
   sprouts.

   Leonard: Good night.

   Sheldon: Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.

   Scene: The hallway.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.

   Sheldon: Thank you. They’re my mother’s.

   Penny: Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you’re gonna
   run really fast?

   Sheldon: No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s
   nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?

   Penny: I don’t have one.

   Sheldon: What about your pedometer?

   Penny: Don’t have one.

   Sheldon: Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an
   iPod?

   Penny: Uh, no.

   Sheldon: What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about
   like a bunny?

   Penny: No. I just run till I’m hungry, then I stop for a bear
   claw.

   Sheldon: Why are you doing that?

   Penny: It’s good to stretch your muscles before you run.

   Sheldon: All right.

   Penny: All right, let’s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do
   it.

   Sheldon: I am doing it.

   Penny: Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?

   Sheldon: We’ll never know.

   Penny: Okay, let’s just warm up on the run.

   Sheldon: Okay.

   Penny: Okay, let’s go.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think
   you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!

   Penny (squealing): Oh, my God, are you okay?

   Sheldon: I think so.

   Penny: Oh, let me help you up.

   Sheldon: Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)

   Penny: Oh, Sheldon!

   Sheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer
   Cruciferous Vegetable Night.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.

   Howard: Thank you, sir.

   Leonard: Palak paneer, that’s Penny.

   Penny: Thanks.

   Leonard: And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these
   tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.

   Penny: Hey, what’s my share?

   Leonard: Uh, 12 bucks.

   Penny: Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?

   Leonard: Sure.

   Penny: What am I up to now?

   Leonard: Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai
   food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a
   little over fourteen hundred dollars.

   Penny (after Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh): What
   now?

   Howard: He’s just expressing his admiration that you don’t even
   have to put out to get free stuff.

   Penny: It’s not free, I’m gonna pay him back. (Raj whispers.
   Both laugh again) Shut up!

   Leonard: Sheldon, are you gonna join us?

   Sheldon: Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device
   consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a
   computer monitor with Sheldon’s face, appears). Greetings,
   friends.

   Leonard: Greetings, whatever the hell you are.

   Sheldon-bot: I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent
   events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to
   endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am
   able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure
   location and interact with the world in this manner.

   Howard (after Raj whispers to him): Really? That’s your
   question? When did he put a ramp in?

   Sheldon-bot: You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at
   first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me
   in this configuration.

   Penny: Yeah, to be honest, I don’t see much difference.

   Sheldon-bot: Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now,
   Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow
   some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your
   convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.

   Leonard: This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.

   Sheldon-bot: You don’t know where I am. My physical body is
   safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.

   Leonard: You’re in your bedroom.

   Sheldon-bot: No, I’m not.

   Leonard: I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.

   Sheldon-bot: No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized
   personnel only!

   Penny: So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear?
   Only fourteen hundred bucks.

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Leonard: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

   Sheldon: I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking
   to me.

   Leonard: I am looking at you.

   Sheldon: No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the
   bed.

   Leonard: You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and
   certainly not at work. Oh, good God.

   Sheldon: At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most
   likely to die?

   Leonard: At the hands of your roommate?

   Sheldon: An accident.

   Leonard: That’s how I’m going to make it look.

   Sheldon: Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable
   container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.

   Leonard: Fine, but don’t expect my help.

   Sheldon: You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.

   Leonard: No, it’s not.

   Sheldon: Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of
   the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.

   Leonard: I’ll be damned.

   Scene: Leonard’s car

   Sheldon-bot: This is delightful.

   Leonard: Uh-huh.

   Sheldon-bot: It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we
   travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular
   death.

   Leonard: Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the
   trunk?

   Sheldon-bot: Because I called shotgun. Remember?

   Leonard: Right.

   Sheldon-bot: You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.

   Leonard: I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.

   Sheldon-bot: Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not
   enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced
   capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.

   Leonard: Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering
   sphincter.

   Sheldon-bot: You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a
   class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive.
   There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How
   many can you name?

   Leonard: I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.

   Sheldon-bot: Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon-bot: This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference
   on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve
   introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll
   give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a
   digital watch. And go.

   Leonard: That’s it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.)

   Sheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on): Bazinga.

   Leonard: Whoa!

   Sheldon-bot: I have an override switch.

   Leonard: I almost died!

   Sheldon-bot : And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?

   Leonard: I’m still going to go with you.

   Scene: A corridor at the university.

   Sheldon-bot : Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy.
   Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your
   theory. Leonard, my door.

   Leonard: What about it?

   Sheldon-bot : Be a lamb and open it for me.

   Leonard: Why? What’s the problem?

   Sheldon-bot : You think you have me stymied, don’t you?

   Leonard: No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.

   Howard: Oh, look, it’s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.

   Raj: That’s my joke. I told it last night. You can’t just use
   it.

   Sheldon-bot : Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.

   Raj: Oh, sure.

   Sheldon-bot : He’s a lamb. You’re not.

   Raj: I’m a lamb.

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory

   Sheldon-bot : Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and
   camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my
   skin.

   Howard: I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some
   Jawas.

   Raj: That’s two, dude. Write your own jokes.

   Penny: Oh, great. Hi, I’m Penny, I’ll be your waitress.

   Leonard: Why are you introducing yourself?

   Penny: I’d rather people not know I have any prior connection
   to you whatsoever.

   Sheldon-bot : Can you tell me the specials this evening?

   Penny: Sheldon, I’m not waiting on you.

   Sheldon-bot: Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.

   Penny: Because you’re not here.

   Sheldon-bot: That’s discrimination against the otherwise
   located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager,
   manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.

   Howard: Is that Steve Wozniak?

   Leonard: I think it is.

   Sheldon-bot : The Great and Powerful Woz.

   Leonard: Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of
   Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…

   Penny: Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.

   Sheldon-bot : I must speak to him.

   Leonard: Of course you must.

   Penny: You know, there’s an Olive Garden down the street. You
   guys should try it sometime.

   Sheldon-bot : Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?

   Steve Wozniak: Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.

   Sheldon-bot : Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan.
   You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.

   Steve Wozniak: Only fifteenth?

   Sheldon-bot : It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care
   neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.

   Steve Wozniak: Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.

   Sheldon-bot : One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977
   Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS
   3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.

   Steve Wozniak: Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if
   you had it here, I’d autograph it for you.

   Sheldon-bot: Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how
   the buses are running.

   Steve Wozniak: Nerds.

   Scene: The hallway. Sheldon exits carrying the Apple 2.

   Sheldon: I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow!
   Aw.

   Scene: The hallway. Sheldon-bot approaches Penny’s door and
   starts bashing into it.

   Sheldon-bot : (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny.

   Penny: What up, Shel-Bot?

   Sheldon-bot: I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.

   Penny: What do you want me to do?

   Sheldon-bot: Sing me Soft Kitty.

   Penny: Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer
   monitor?

   Sheldon-bot: Would you rather come over and sing it to me in
   person?

   Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.

   Sheldon-bot: Closer to the microphone.

   Penny: Happy kitty, sleepy…

   Sheldon-bot: No. You have to start over.

   Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty,
   sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
