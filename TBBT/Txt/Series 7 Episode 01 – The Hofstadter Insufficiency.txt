Series 7 Episode 01 – The Hofstadter Insufficiency

   Scene: On the deck of a ship on the North Sea, in the middle of
   a storm. Leonard is on a sat-phone.

   Leonard: Sheldon, it’s not a great time, what do you want?

   Sheldon (in the apartment): Hello to you, too. I’m sorry, but
   this is important.

   Leonard: What is it?

   Sheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future
   III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back
   to the Future II case.

   Leonard: So?

   Sheldon: So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an
   intruder?

   Leonard: Sheldon, I got to go inside. It’s getting rough out
   here.

   Sheldon: You’re dodging the question, I knew it was you. What
   was that?

   Leonard: What was what?

   Sheldon: This isn’t a very good connection, but it sounded like
   someone just released a kraken.

   Leonard: Okay, I’m hanging up now. You know there’s no such
   thing as a k… (Leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by
   a huge tentacle. Sheldon wakes up in bed.)

   Sheldon: No!

   Scene: Penny’s apartment door.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: What’s the matter?

   Sheldon: Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing
   Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like
   the kind you’d get if you watched Clash of the Titans right
   before you went to bed.

   Penny: Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?

   Sheldon: To be honest, I did.

   Penny: Aw.

   Sheldon: Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future
   III case. Leonard did it.

   Penny: Good night.

   Sheldon: No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don’t
   miss Leonard as much, uh, ’cause you’re being kind of a baby
   about it.

   Penny: You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank
   you.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. Good night.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Raj: I think you’d be pleased to hear that this morning in the
   parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was
   shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn’t get upset
   at all.

   Howard: I’m proud of you.

   Raj: Well, you should be, ’cause she was looking good.

   Sheldon: Dear Lord, you’re an astronomer. Although you may have
   earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the
   lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky
   Way.

   Raj: Is that true?

   Sheldon: Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung
   beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making
   little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which
   aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.

   Howard: Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn’t be
   hard for you to meet someone new.

   Raj: How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see
   Lucy’s face? Tell me you don’t see her smile in the crust of
   this chicken pot pie.

   Howard: Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there’s a
   welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet
   someone who isn’t made of grease or pie.

   Raj: You think you’re so cool because your wife is a person?

   Howard: Look, Bernie’s at a neuroscience conference with Amy,
   I’ll go with you.

   Raj: You would do that for me?

   Howard: Of course. You’re my friend. I want you to be happy.

   Raj: Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy’s out of town, would you
   like to join us?

   Sheldon: I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do
   anything about it.

   Scene: A hotel room.

   Bernadette (on phone): Howie, stop. I can’t talk like that.
   Amy’s right here.

   Amy (on phone): Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not
   bring home bed bugs.

   Bernadette: The hotel’s nice. There’s a pool, a gym, the bar
   looks like fun.

   Amy: Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.

   Bernadette: Aw, I love you, too. If I don’t talk to you before
   you go to sleep, I’ll meet you in dreamland.

   Amy: Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment
   bag.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains…

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve piqued your interest, welcome to
   the exciting world of 3D chess.

   Penny: Why don’t you just admit you only want to play this game
   because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?

   Sheldon: You overestimate his significance in my life.

   Penny: Mmm.

   Sheldon: Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle
   with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my
   jacket when it gets stuck? I don’t think so. Do I miss how we
   say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom
   using Morse code? (Taps out No in morse code on the table)

   Penny: Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.

   Sheldon: Well, I try.

   Penny: All right, let’s just get this stupid game over with.

   Sheldon: Great. I’ll go first.

   Penny: Okay.

   Sheldon: By the way, how are you with zippers?

   Penny: Why?

   Sheldon: Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this
   one’s gone all cattywampus.

   Scene: The mixer party.

   Raj: Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so
   interesting.

   Girl: It is. You can download my paper off the university
   server.

   Raj: I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts
   from the university server as well.

   Girl: I will.

   Raj: All right.

   Howard: How’d it go?

   Raj: Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed
   with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.

   Howard: Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here.
   She’s probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.

   Raj: Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.

   Howard: I heard her husband left her for a hot, young
   undergrad.

   Raj: That’s so much better than the old, ugly ones.

   Mrs Davis: Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali.

   Howard: Mrs. Davis, nice to see you.

   Raj: You know, I recently read a fascinating article on
   infidelity among penguins.

   Mrs Davis: Okay.

   Raj: So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel
   unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and
   they’re adorable.

   Howard: It was better when you couldn’t talk to women.

   Scene: The hotel bar.

   Bernadette: I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior
   cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical
   memory.

   Amy: Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they’re yours,
   then they’re a drag.

   Bernadette: To the advancement of science.

   Amy: And to the sick and dying who make it possible.

   Bernadette: This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with
   Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.

   Amy: Which is fine, but it’s nice to mix it up with a little
   intellectual conversation.

   Waiter: From the two gentlemen at the bar.

   Amy: Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks.
   Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.

   Bernadette: Be cool.

   Amy: You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get
   to Penny.

   Bernadette: You’re right. Thank you.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Ooh. Bad move.

   Penny: Really? Why?

   Sheldon: My queen can now take your rook from below.

   Penny: So that means I lose, right? It’s over?

   Sheldon: If I make this move, but I won’t because we’re having
   too much fun.

   Penny: Okay, let’s take a break.

   Sheldon: We’re all out of alcohol.

   Penny: I wasn’t going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what
   Leonard’s doing right now. I miss him so much.

   Sheldon: Well, if you’d like, we could call him. I mean that
   you could call him. As I’ve explained, the absence of my
   friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul
   Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.

   Penny: I’m calling him.

   Sheldon: Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.

   Leonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing): Excuse me,
   ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?

   Penny: Leonard?

   Leonard: Penny? Hey, it’s Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.

   Everybody: Hi, Penny!

   Penny: Wow, it sounds like you’re having a good time.

   Leonard: Best time of my life.

   Sheldon: Isn’t it five thirty in the morning there?

   Leonard: Is it? Hey, everybody, it’s five thirty in the
   morning!

   Penny: Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were
   missing you.

   Random voice: Iceberg!

   Leonard: Uh-oh, hang on.

   Sheldon: Are you in danger?

   Leonard: No, it’s a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg,
   we take a shot!

   Everybody: Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!

   Penny: Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that
   jerk.

   Sheldon: You were.

   Scene: The hotel bar.

   Amy: So what happened? How’d it go?

   Bernadette: It’s fine. I thanked them again and let them know
   we’re not available.

   Amy: So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?

   Bernadette: Yes, it’s all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk
   to one of them, no one would blame you.

   Amy: And why would no one blame me?

   Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m saying.

   Amy: Well, it sounds like you’re saying that I could do better
   than Sheldon.

   Bernadette: Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I’m gonna
   be huggin’ the toilet tonight.

   Amy: No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.

   Bernadette: I just meant that you’re not married and your
   boyfriend’s kind of, Sheldon.

   Amy: And your husband is extremely Howard. What’s your point?

   Bernadette: Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to
   say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?

   Amy: We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I
   remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.

   Bernadette: Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?

   Amy: Sure.

   Bernadette: Thanks.

   Amy: Your husband’s weird and his clothes are ridiculous.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: I can’t believe it. All this time I’ve been doing
   nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the
   worst part is?

   Sheldon: That you’re having to process your emotional pain
   without vodka?

   Penny: No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He
   does not miss me at all.

   Sheldon: Allow me to comfort you. At least you’ve got your
   health.

   Penny: Really? That, that’s it? That’s comforting?

   Sheldon: Um, uh, in a hundred years, you’ll both be dead and it
   won’t matter?

   Penny: No. Come on, you’re supposed to say, of course he misses
   you, the only reason he’s partying is to cover up his pain.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, I don’t think that’s true at all.

   Penny: This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he’s off
   having a good time?

   Sheldon: Well, perhaps you’re obsessively picturing him engaged
   in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it
   right?

   Penny: Okay, that, that’s great. You can stop trying to make me
   feel better now.

   Sheldon: Actually, I can’t. Before Leonard left, he made me
   promise that I’d take care of you.

   Penny: He did?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Penny: Oh, that’s really sweet.

   Sheldon: Plus, if I do a good job, he said he’d bring me back a
   sailor’s cap.

   Penny: Well, now I miss him even more.

   Sheldon: Well, if it’s any consolation, I’m sure Leonard’s
   tormented every moment he’s away from your warm embrace and
   cherry lips.

   Penny: Thanks.

   Sheldon: Oh, seriously?

   Scene: The mixer.

   Raj: Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?

   Mrs Davis: What?

   Raj: I’d like to apologize for being insensitive. And for
   possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them
   are stand-up guys.

   Mrs Davis: Forget about it.

   Raj: You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.

   Mrs Davis: Is that right?

   Raj: Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay,
   fine, I’ll tell you about it.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It’s in a to-go
   cup. Make of that what you will.

   Penny: Come on. It’s still early. Let’s do something.

   Sheldon: Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D
   chess.

   Penny: How about we just talk?

   Sheldon: All right. In 4D chess…

   Penny: No. Come on, let’s talk about our lives. Tell me
   something about you I don’t know.

   Sheldon: I own nine pairs of pants.

   Penny: Okay, that, that’s a good start, but I was thinking
   maybe something a little more personal.

   Sheldon: I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.

   Penny: How about I go first?

   Sheldon: But I don’t want to know how many underpants you own.
   Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I’d say it’s a
   thousand.

   Penny: Okay, look, here’s something people do not know about
   me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a
   low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I
   did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came
   out.

   Sheldon: I’ve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it
   online the day we met you.

   Penny: Oh, God.

   Sheldon: And it was literally the moment you walked out the
   door. But I see the type of personal revelations you’re going
   for. Okay, here’s one I thought I’d take to the grave.

   Penny: Okay.

   Sheldon: Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface
   from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I
   tell people I’m okay with it, but I’m really not.

   Penny: That’s your big revelation?

   Sheldon: Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.

   Penny: Okay, you know what? I give up. I’m going to bed.

   Sheldon: Here’s something else you don’t know about me. You
   just hurt my feelings.

   Penny: What did I do?

   Sheldon: I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to
   me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.

   Penny: I, I didn’t think it was a big deal.

   Sheldon: It is to me; that’s the point.

   Penny: Sheldon, you are right. I’m really sorry. I should’ve
   known better.

   Sheldon: Your apology is accepted.

   Penny: Thank you. How about a hug?

   Sheldon: How about a hearty handshake?

   Penny: Come on.

   Sheldon: Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that
   sex-crazed gorilla.

   Scene: The hotel room.

   Bernadette: Good night.

   Amy: Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us
   drinks.

   Bernadette: Yeah, that felt nice.

   Amy: Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if
   we can score us some free omelettes.

   Bernadette: So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone
   with them, which one would you have picked?

   Amy: I think I would have gone with the short one with the
   goofy haircut.

   Bernadette: Oh, good, ’cause I liked the tall thin one. He
   seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually
   inexperienced, like I’d have to teach him a thing or two.

   Amy: Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It’d be nice
   to be with a man who wants to know what’s underneath my
   cardigan. FYI, it’s another cardigan.

   Bernadette: Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.

   Amy: Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.

   Both: Good night.

   Scene: The mixer.

   Mrs Davis: All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it’s been nice talking
   to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.

   Raj: Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.

   Mrs Davis: Yeah, it’s exactly the same thing. Good night.

   Raj: Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in
   a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I
   got to connect with you at a human level. That’s a much better
   evening. You’re a lovely person.

   Mrs Davis: Are you hitting on me?

   Raj: No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting
   on you, you’d know it ’cause you’d feel uncomfortable and a
   little sad for me.

   Mrs Davis: You’re sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.

   Raj: Good night.

   Howard: Looks like she accepted your apology.

   Raj: And then some. I think we had a moment.

   Howard: Oh, please, you did not have a moment.

   Raj: Who died and made you king of moments?

   Howard: Okay, fine. Let’s say there was a moment.

   Raj: There was.

   Howard: There wasn’t. But, but even if there was, what are you
   gonna do about it?

   Raj: I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my
   bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.

   Howard: So nothing.

   Raj: No, not a thing.

   Scene: A bathroom shower.

   Penny (acting): Ah, I’m so glad the police finally caught that
   psychotic genetically engineered ape.

   Leonard (on ship): That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.

   Everyone (on ship): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!

   Penny: Aaaaaaah!
