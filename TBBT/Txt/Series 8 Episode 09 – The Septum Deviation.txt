Series 8 Episode 09 – The Septum Deviation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: This is an easy one. You love this guy.

   Sheldon: Me.

   Amy: Come on, he’s an under-appreciated genius.

   Sheldon: Still think it’s me.

   Amy: It’s not you. Now think, there’s a car named after him.

   Sheldon: Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ’cause it’s me.

   Amy: How about this, he’s a poor man’s Sheldon Cooper.

   Sheldon: Oh, Tesla.

   Penny: Hi.

   Amy: Hello.

   Sheldon: Hey, how did it go?

   Leonard: Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my
   sinuses.

   Penny: Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in
   Willy Wonka.

   Amy: Did they figure out what’s wrong?

   Leonard: Yeah. It’s a deviated septum. The surgery to correct
   it is simple. He’s gonna do it next week.

   Sheldon: Why would you have surgery?

   Leonard: Because I can’t breathe. I snore, I get sinus
   infections.

   Penny: Yeah, back off, he’s all mine.

   Sheldon: But you don’t have a life-threatening condition. Why
   would you take the risk of surgery?

   Amy: Sheldon, it’s a routine procedure, I’ve heard you complain
   about his snoring.

   Sheldon: Yes, for the first five or six years, but I’ve gotten
   used to it. It helps me sleep. He’s like my mucus-powered white
   noise machine.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I’m gonna get the surgery, it’s no big deal.
   End of story.

   Sheldon: Very well. I’m done talking about it.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: I believe it was your turn in the game.

   Amy: Okay.

   Sheldon: Let’s see. Oh, this person is most famous for never
   having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and
   never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous,
   disfigured freak.

   Leonard: I think you could give a better clue.

   Sheldon: I don’t. I’m not even sure if that’s a person or a
   typo.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.

   Leonard: Okay, why?

   Sheldon: I’m listening to you snore. I’m wondering how I’ll
   ever sleep without it.

   Leonard: If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here
   staring at me like the albino boogeyman?

   Sheldon: Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in
   your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?

   Leonard: What’s your problem?

   Sheldon: If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And
   if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.

   Leonard: It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.

   Sheldon: I have to be honest with you Leonard, I’m truly
   worried.

   Leonard: I told you, there’s nothing to worry about.

   Sheldon: Well, I’ve been doing some research and I’ve learned
   that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.

   Leonard: Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999
   people don’t die?

   Sheldon: I suppose that’s true. You’re such a glass half-full
   kind of guy. I’m going to miss that.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Raj: Oh, so, my, uh, parents’ 40th anniversary’s coming up and
   I can’t think of a thing to get them.

   Howard: Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40
   years?

   Bernadette: Not anymore.

   Raj: Anyway, any ideas on a gift?

   Bernadette: Well, what are some of the things they like?

   Raj: They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last
   year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said
   based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.

   Bernadette: He said that to her?

   Raj: Well, they weren’t speaking at the time, so he had a
   servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them.
   I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.

   Bernadette: They’re yours in the divorce.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Hey. What’re you working on?

   Sheldon: Remember when I said if you went through with your
   surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?

   Leonard: Yeah?

   Sheldon: Well, I’ve been crunching the numbers, and so far,
   I’ve gotten your probability of death all the way to a
   sphincter-tightening one in 300.

   Leonard: Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.

   Sheldon: Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the
   surgeon’s latex gloves?

   Leonard: I’m not allergic to latex.

   Sheldon: Well, then why don’t you wear the rubber gloves I
   bought for you to do the dishes?

   Leonard: For the same reason I don’t wear the apron or the hair
   net.

   Sheldon: Fine. What about epilepsy?

   Leonard: I don’t have epilepsy, either.

   Sheldon: You don’t, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your
   carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the
   dancing fountain at Disneyland.

   Leonard: Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than
   surgery?

   Sheldon: I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here.
   That is if you make it to the car without falling down the
   stairs. And don’t expect me to carry you, I do that enough in
   life.

   Leonard: Buddy, I, I get that you’re worried about me and I, I
   appreciate that, but I’m not going to die.

   Sheldon: You don’t know that.

   Leonard: Well, I do know that it won’t be from an asteroid
   strike.

   Sheldon: You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex
   currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.

   Leonard: If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn’t you die,
   too?

   Sheldon: I don’t know, I’m smart and scrappy, I think I’d find
   a way.

   Leonard: Tell you what, the surgery’s not for a week, I’ll
   think about it.

   Sheldon: Thank you. And while you’re thinking about it, if you
   have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can
   practically guarantee your death.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj (on phone): Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes.
   I’ll call you tomorrow. Bye.

   Howard: So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a
   Jedi class. And if you’re cool being the only adults there,
   they said they are.

   Raj: Dude, my parents just split up.

   Howard: What?

   Raj: Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.

   Howard: Oh, my God, I, I’m sorry. I mean, if you’re not up to
   it, we don’t have to go out, we can just hang here.

   Raj: No, it’s fine. It’s not that big a deal. As long as
   they’re happy, I’m happy. And when I get to see them for the
   holidays, I’ll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each
   house. That’s double the Diwali.

   Howard: You sure you’re okay?

   Raj: I’m okay.

   Howard: You don’t look okay.

   Raj: How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.

   Scene: A waiting room.

   Leonard: The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.

   Penny: Okay. And Sheldon really believes we’re at a public
   swimming pool?

   Leonard: He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million
   of urine we’d be floating around in, he didn’t even question
   it.

   Scene: Amy’s car.

   Sheldon: 18 parts per million. And he’s still doing it.

   Amy: Don’t worry about that. I’m happy to take you to work.

   Sheldon: Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French
   toast sticks in the car. I can’t have syrupy fingers, but he
   can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.

   Amy: It’s nice they’re getting exercise.

   Sheldon: Although now that I think about it, Leonard would
   never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.

   Amy: I’m sure he brought it.

   Sheldon: No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a
   bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.

   Amy: He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look,
   there’s an entire section of my dashboard that doesn’t have any
   syrup on it.

   Sheldon: You’re acting odd. Why?

   Amy: I’m odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night
   I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.

   Sheldon: Tell me the truth.

   Amy: Twenty eight.

   Sheldon: Come on.

   Amy: Fifty six.

   Sheldon: Amy. What’s going on?

   Amy: All right. Don’t get upset, but, an earlier appointment
   opened up for Leonard and he’s getting the surgery right now.

   Sheldon: I see. Take me to Leonard.

   Amy: Just go to work, he’ll be fine.

   Sheldon: Amy, he’s my best friend, and if you don’t take me,
   I’m going there anyway.

   Amy: Fine. It’s sweet that you care about him so much.

   Sheldon: I do. And I wouldn’t be able to forgive myself if
   something happened to him and I wasn’t at his bedside to say I
   told you so.

   Scene: The waiting room.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Penny: We had a really nice swim.

   Sheldon: Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre’s already
   treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.

   Penny: ‘Cause I’m a liar, liar?

   Sheldon: That’s for the fire marshal to determine.

   Penny: You had to tell him?

   Amy: He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra
   baby powder today.

   Sheldon: Is he okay?

   Penny: He’s still in surgery.

   Sheldon: Very well.

   Penny: He’s gonna be all right. That is sticky.

   Amy: Come on, let’s talk about something other than the
   surgery.

   Sheldon: That’s a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever
   discuss funeral arrangements?

   Penny: I think she meant something a little happier.

   Sheldon: I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but
   he died so young.

   Scene: Raj’s office.

   Howard: Knock, knock.

   Bernadette: Hi.

   Raj: Hey. What brings you by?

   Bernadette: Oh, muffin much.

   Howard: Told you, not funny.

   Bernadette: He’s just not laughing because he’s feeling
   blueberry. Tough crowd.

   Raj: I’m sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.

   Howard: So, how you doing?

   Raj: Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I
   expected.

   Bernadette: Well, of course. I would be devastated if my
   parents split up.

   Howard: Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.

   Bernadette: Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad,
   who just took off.

   Howard: As you can see, we’re here to cheer you up.

   Bernadette: Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened
   with your folks?

   Raj: I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and
   instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they
   kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.

   Bernadette: It’s a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But
   sometimes, there’s muffin you can do about it. You get it,
   right?

   Scene: The waiting room.

   Penny: Oh, it’s nice you got him that.

   Sheldon: Oh, this isn’t for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.

   Amy: Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.

   Sheldon: You know those confounded things make me dizzy.

   Amy: Who told you to keep going around?

   Sheldon: There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking
   like the outside.

   Penny: Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna
   feel great, so, please don’t give him a hard time.

   Amy: Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the
   supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you’re
   thinking, just keep it to yourself.

   Sheldon: It was like a grapefruit.

   Amy: And I’m sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up
   next to it.

   Sheldon: Well, I’m not making any promises. Not only did
   Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived
   me.

   Penny: Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a
   pain in the ass.

   Sheldon: The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I
   was worried about him, and no one else was.

   Penny: Really? You won’t even say A?

   Sheldon: You bet your sweet B I won’t.

   Penny: Obviously, I care about Leonard. I’m gonna spend the
   rest of my life with him.

   Sheldon: And I’m not? It’s an earthquake. I knew it.

   Penny: Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.

   Sheldon: A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into
   a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don’t care for this at all. Oh, I
   need to see he’s okay.

   Amy: Sheldon, you can’t go back there.

   Sheldon: Try and stop me.

   Amy: Are you okay?

   Sheldon: Why didn’t you stop me?

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: Can I tell you something? This whole thing with
   Raj’s parents just got me a little worried about us.

   Howard: What are you talking about? We’re fine. And Raj’s
   parents probably split up because of Raj.

   Bernadette: What?

   Howard: They always say the children aren’t to blame, but, come
   on.

   Bernadette: I’m not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about
   his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I
   don’t want that to happen to us.

   Howard: How can I convince you it won’t?

   Bernadette: Well, is there anything about me you’re keeping
   inside?

   Howard: I’m not answering that. It’s a trap.

   Bernadette: So there are things you don’t like.

   Howard: And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I’m
   gonna chew my leg off.

   Bernadette: Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I
   promise I won’t get mad.

   Howard: Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you’re too beautiful.

   Bernadette: Oh. Howie, be serious.

   Howard: Okay, okay. I really don’t like how your wings poke me
   when we sleep ’cause you’re an angel.

   Bernadette: Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.

   Howard: I just don’t think the secret to a happy marriage is
   going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there
   are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when
   I was in couples therapy was…

   Bernadette: Who were you in couples therapy with?

   Howard: Not important.

   Bernadette: Was it your mom?

   Howard: Not important.

   Bernadette: It was your mom.

   Howard: Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we
   loved about one another.

   Bernadette: Oh, that’s so sweet. I want to do that.

   Howard: All right.

   Bernadette: Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.

   Howard: Thank you. And I love that you’re strong and
   independent.

   Bernadette: And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.

   Howard: I love that I’m kind of a slob around here, and you’re
   okay with that.

   Bernadette: Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the
   cleaning, and you’re okay with that.

   Howard: See, I am. Isn’t this great?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.

   Sheldon: You know this is all your fault.

   Leonard: How is it my fault?

   Sheldon: I told you not to get the surgery.

   Leonard: Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and
   secondly, I didn’t even want you there.

   Sheldon: Wow. I don’t know which hurts worse, my nose or my
   heart. Well, I’m done speaking to you.

   Amy: Don’t be like that. You two need to talk this out.

   Penny: Yeah, ’cause you sound really funny.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the
   surgery, but you were worried about nothing.

   Sheldon: Oh, you’re hardly out of the woods, no. You still run
   the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an
   inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose.
   The minute you sneeze web, I’m moving out.

   Leonard: I never thought I’d say these words, but come on, nose
   spider.

   Penny: Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was
   gonna die, you’ll never leave him.

   Amy: Sheldon will move out eventually.

   Penny: Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.

   Sheldon: I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to
   Leonard.

   Leonard: You were so worried that you smashed your face trying
   to check on me. You love me.

   Sheldon: Yeah. Tell me those aren’t the words of a man with a
   spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you’re a
   neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: I love that you take pride in your looks, even when
   I have to pee in the morning, and you’re in there spending an
   hour on your hair.

   Howard: I love that you’re too good to pee in the kitchen sink.

   Bernadette: I love that you have the confidence to speak, even
   without giving it an ounce of thought.

   Howard: And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It’s
   like washing myself with a hamster.

   Raj: Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my
   mother.

   Bernadette: Oh, how is she?

   Raj: Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used
   it to set my father’s Mercedes on fire. So, what’s up with you
   guys?

   Howard: We’re just saying all the things we love about each
   other.

   Raj: Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Oh, what’d you get?

   Sheldon: Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It’s the urn I
   was going to put you in.

   Penny: Okay, that’s morbid. Send it back.

   Sheldon: I can’t send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the
   ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his
   room mate knew better.”

   Leonard: That’s funny. Boy, I’m gonna miss these painkillers.

   Penny: Hey, why did you get two? I’m with stupid.

   Sheldon: Oh, that one’s mine.
