Series 8 Episode 01 – The Locomotion Interruption

   Following a “previously on” sequence.

   Scene: A railway station. Sheldon is wearing no trousers.

   Sheldon: Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting
   a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified.
   But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked
   on a railroad journey of healing because my university was
   making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store
   burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend
   wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to
   see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts.
   Uh, sir, may I use your phone?

   Man: I don’t think so.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but
   there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper
   car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear
   pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas
   are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma
   Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good
   man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear
   deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me
   the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask.
   Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My
   legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Morning.

   Penny: Hi. Want to do yoga with me?

   Leonard: Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll
   have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that.
   (Phone rings) Hello?

   Sheldon: Hello, Leonard.

   Leonard: Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.

   Sheldon: Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to
   come pick me up.

   Leonard: I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.

   Sheldon: Leonard, I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They
   took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.

   Leonard: Oh, my God, are you okay?

   Sheldon: No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I
   don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop
   calling me chicken legs.

   Leonard: Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?

   Penny: Hey, what’s going on?

   Leonard: He got all of his stuff stolen.

   Penny: Oh.


   Sheldon: 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,

   Leonard: Okay.

   Sheldon: Hurry.

   Leonard: Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring
   anything?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush.
   Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs,
   because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony
   silence.

   Leonard: I’ll be there as soon as I can.

   Penny: Is he okay?

   Leonard: Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled.

   Penny: Oh.

   Leonard: Feel like driving to Arizona with me?

   Penny: I can’t, I have that job interview.

   Leonard: Oh, right.

   Penny: Besides, I don’t need six hours of your hair is
   different, why did you change your hair? I’m holding my breath
   until your hair grows back.

   Leonard: All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I
   shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?

   Penny: Nope.

   Leonard: Come on, you didn’t even try.

   Scene: Howard’s car.

   Raj: Thanks for the lift.

   Howard: What’s wrong with your car?

   Raj: I’m having my windows untinted.

   Howard: Why?

   Raj: Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.

   Howard: What are you talking about? No one’s paying attention
   to you.

   Raj: Wow. How’s that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn’t the
   way to work.

   Howard: I just want to pop in and make sure Ma’s okay.

   Raj: I thought Stuart was looking after her.

   Howard: He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And
   honestly, I’m kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.

   Raj: How so?

   Howard: I don’t know, they’re, chummy.

   Raj: Like us?

   Howard: No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.

   Raj: She feeds him out of her own mouth?

   Howard: I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and
   they’re all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food
   goes in that mouth, it does not come out.

   Raj: So are you worried because he’s replacing you as a son or
   are you worried because he’s becoming her lover?

   Howard: First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I’m her
   little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having
   any kind of sex life.

   Raj: Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant,
   active…

   Howard: I said well past it.

   Scene: Kingman Police Station.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person
   who stole my belongings?

   Hernandez: Not yet.

   Sheldon: Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says
   when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however
   improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing
   that?

   Hernandez: Nope.

   Sheldon: Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called
   Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Leonard: Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long
   drive by myself.

   Amy: My pleasure. And I’m not angry at all that my boyfriend
   was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,

   Leonard: Yeah, time’s gonna fly by.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Penny: I haven’t been on a job interview in years. I’m really
   nervous.

   Bernadette: Don’t be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales.
   You’re cute, you’re flirty and started that like there were
   gonna be three things.

   Penny: I don’t have any experience in sales. Unless you count
   the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made
   me take that off my résumé.

   Bernadette: This job is a lot like being a waitress, except
   instead of pushing the fish tacos ’cause they’re about to go
   bad, you’re just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA
   finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.

   Penny: They do?

   Bernadette: Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full
   of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked
   you up to Dan. He’s the guy who’ll be interviewing you.

   Penny: Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I’m not in
   over my head.

   Bernadette: You’ll be fine. Just be yourself.

   Penny: I wish I felt more confident.

   Bernadette: Penny, I wouldn’t have put you up for this job if I
   didn’t think you could handle it.

   Penny: Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.

   Bernadette: It’s too late to cancel. You’re going.

   Penny: But I don’t know anything about pharmaceuticals.

   Bernadette: Oh, I understand. You want to do something you’re
   already good at. I know. Why don’t I get you a job at the
   Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?

   Penny: They’re comfortable.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Howard: Ma, I hope you’re decent. Raj is here. You just started
   seeing naked women again, and I don’t want you to be confused
   about where the boobs should be.

   Stuart: Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?

   Howard: Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.

   Stuart: Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to
   talking over dinner the other night. I didn’t have any place to
   go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at
   the same time. It was precious.

   Howard: It’s not that precious.

   Raj: I’d like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty
   precious.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, I can’t find my glasses.

   Stuart: Be right there, Deb Deb. They’re probably on her head.

   Howard: Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like
   something she would’ve talked to me about.

   Stuart: Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you’d
   know.

   Raj: It wouldn’t kill you to pick up the phone.

   Scene: Kingman Police Station.

   Sheldon: Any word on my stolen items?

   Hernandez: We’re doing everything we can.

   Sheldon: You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to
   sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are
   doing the trick.

   Leonard: Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Leonard. Oh, I’m so happy to see you.

   Amy: Are you okay?

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?

   Amy: What do you mean, why did I come? You’re my boyfriend. I
   haven’t seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to
   help you out. Don’t you have anything to say besides why did
   you come?

   Sheldon: I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in
   front of these police officers.

   Amy: Fine. Whisper it.

   Sheldon (whispers): Shotgun.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Leonard: So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?

   Sheldon: Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago,
   Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.

   Leonard: How were they?

   Sheldon: Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.

   Leonard: Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and
   never left a train station?

   Sheldon: Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are.

   Leonard: I’m sorry, so you never went outside?

   Sheldon: Or had a single piece of fruit.

   Scene: Pharmaceutical Company Office.

   Dan: So, why do you think you’d make a good pharmaceutical
   sales rep?

   Penny: Well, I’m a people person. People like me. Some of my
   favourite people are people. I feel like I’m saying people a
   lot. People, people, people. Okay, I’m done.

   Dan: You sure?

   Penny: People. Yes.

   Dan: Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has
   prepared you for a career like this?

   Penny: Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job.
   I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers,
   who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I
   mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.

   Dan: Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.

   Penny: People.

   Scene: Howard’s car.

   Howard: It’s weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living
   with my mother.

   Raj: That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.

   Howard: Come on, you don’t think it’s a little odd?

   Raj: I don’t know. I mean, she’s lonely. He needs a place to
   stay. I doubt there’s any funny business going on. And even if
   there was, who cares? They’re both adults.

   Howard: Who cares? You wouldn’t care if I slept with your mom?

   Raj: You know what? You’re my best friend, and she’s in a bad
   marriage. I give you my blessing.

   Howard: This is stupid. I’m just gonna call my mother and be
   honest with her.

   Raj: ‘Cause that’s what little matzo balls do.

   Stuart (voice on answerphone): This is Debbie.

   Mrs Wolowitz (voice on answerphone): And this is Stuart.

   Together: Just kidding.

   Stuart (voice on answerphone): Leave a message.

   Raj: This is the part where you talk.

   Scene: Pharmaceutical Company Office.

   Dan: All right, let’s say a physician was prescribing one of
   our competitor’s drugs. How would you convince them to switch
   to ours?

   Penny: Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a
   bikini? No. Okay, I’m really sorry for wasting your time.

   Dan: Don’t worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.

   Penny: Okay, thanks. Um, I’m sorry, listen, could you do me a
   favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview?
   She’ll get upset. And honestly I’m a, a little terrified of
   her.

   Dan: Wait, wait. You’re scared of Bernadette?

   Penny: Yeah, kind of.

   Dan: I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she’s so nice
   with that squeaky little voice.

   Penny: I know, but she’s kind of a bully.

   Dan: Wll, she is. I didn’t even want to meet you, but, uh, I
   was too scared to say no to her.

   Penny: Me, too.

   Dan: Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we
   were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she
   was developing.

   Penny: What happened?

   Dan: I couldn’t do it. She’s still working on it. Oh, we’re not
   gonna tell her about this, right?

   Penny: Oh, my God, no.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Sheldon: At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station,
   Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train
   station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the
   Indianapolis train station?

   Leonard: I don’t care.

   Sheldon: Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to
   move on to the mustard round?

   Amy: Have you not noticed that I’ve been sitting back here
   quietly stewing for the past two hours?

   Sheldon: I just thought you were bad at the game.

   Amy: I’m mad at you. How could you just go away like that
   without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help
   instead of me?

   Sheldon: Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak
   with my roommate?

   Amy: We’re in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick
   my fingers in my ears?

   Sheldon: Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like
   a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As
   soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she
   can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want
   Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own.

   Leonard: What’s the big deal?

   Sheldon: Oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me,
   and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me
   on.

   Leonard: Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me.

   Amy: Can I stop now?

   Leonard: Just tell her.

   Sheldon: I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want
   you to think less of me.

   Amy: You were worried about that?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Amy: Sheldon, it’s okay with me that you’re not perfect.

   Sheldon: Can I have one more moment with Leonard?

   Amy: Sure.

   Sheldon: Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with
   her.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: Now, I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of
   excited to see Sheldon.

   Bernadette: I never thought I’d say this, but Penny got a job
   today.

   Howard: She did?

   Bernadette: Well, the only reason she got it is ’cause the guy
   who interviewed her loves me.

   Howard (answering a knock on the door): What do you want?

   Stuart: I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay
   with me staying at your mom’s.

   Howard: You’re right, I’m not. I think it’s weird.

   Bernadette: Howie?

   Howard: It is. He’s a grown man. He’s just gonna live there
   rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt
   and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?

   Stuart: Hey, you’re not my father, okay? And besides, your
   mother and I were talking…

   Howard: Your mother and I? You’re not my father.

   Stuart: I didn’t say I was your father.

   Howard: Well, I didn’t say I was your father.

   Bernadette: Okay, calm down. You’re not his father, he’s not
   your father. Nobody’s anybody’s father.

   Stuart: I, I’m sorry you don’t like my life choices, but it’s
   my life.

   Howard: Well, it’s my house, it’s my rules.

   Stuart: Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my
   allowance?

   Bernadette: Hey, don’t you take that sarcastic tone with him.

   Stuart: I don’t have to listen to you.

   Howard: Don’t talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife.
   My wife. I said my wife.

   Stuart: You know what? This isn’t getting us anywhere. When
   you’re ready to apologize, you know where to find me.

   Howard: Yeah, in my house.

   Stuart: That’s right, sucka.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better
   now than when I left.

   Amy: But you still accomplished something.

   Leonard: Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away
   on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what
   they would have said?

   Sheldon: That I couldn’t do it?

   Leonard: Exactly. Right after they said yeah.

   Amy: But you did do it. So what if it didn’t all go your way?
   That’s what makes it an adventure.

   Sheldon: That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf
   the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever
   as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and
   I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in
   direct sunlight for six weeks.

   Amy: See? This trip was good for you.

   Sheldon: Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And
   then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst
   forth as the world’s smartest butterfly.

   Leonard: Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any
   changes that come my way.

   All: Hey.

   Penny: Hey, look who’s back.

   Sheldon: Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t
   take this. I’m out.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Would you like to see pictures from my trip?

   Penny: I thought your phone got stolen.

   Sheldon: Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up
   to the Cloud.

   Leonard: And you thought they all had a silver lining.

   Sheldon: Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to
   sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As
   it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom.
   This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the
   train bathroom.

   Penny: I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and
   never left the train station.

   Sheldon: I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des
   Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave
   out.
