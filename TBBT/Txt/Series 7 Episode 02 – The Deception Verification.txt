Series 7 Episode 02 – The Deception Verification

   Scene: The stairwell

   Sheldon: And here’s another interesting weather fact.

   Penny: Another? Great.

   Sheldon: Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which
   the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make
   the day longer.

   Penny: Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.

   Sheldon: Joke if you must, but you’re going to miss these
   moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last
   time driving me to the grocery store.

   Penny: You know, I will miss this.

   Sheldon: I’ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we’ll hit
   the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can
   even push the cart. Please don’t take my looking forward to
   Leonard’s return as criticism of the job you’ve been doing in
   his absence.

   Penny: I won’t.

   Sheldon: That criticism will come later in your report card.

   Penny: Yeah, I didn’t stay for the detention, I’m not gonna
   read the report card.

   Leonard (in Penny’s apartment): Hello.

   Penny (screams): Leonard! Hi!

   Leonard: Keep your voice down.

   Penny: Oh, my God. You weren’t supposed to be here till Sunday.

   Leonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d
   come home and surprise you.

   Penny: Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?

   Leonard: I didn’t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days
   alone.

   Penny: Oh, that is so romantic.

   Leonard: Uh, sure, that’s why I did it.

   Penny: Oh, I just cannot believe you’re here.

   Sheldon (off): Penny, it’s your lucky day. Three of the eggs
   are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Sheldon: Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find
   something.

   Stuart: Happy to, unless it’s hope or a reason to live.

   Sheldon: Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will
   be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for
   him. As he’s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical
   theme might be appropriate.

   Stuart: Okay, well, I don’t know how much you want to spend,
   but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.

   Sheldon: Aquaman? Oh, this isn’t a gag gift, Stuart.

   Stuart: Yeah, just as well. It’s a pretty rare piece. I’d
   rather just sell it to a real collector.

   Sheldon: I’m a real collector. How rare is it?

   Stuart: Oh, I shouldn’t even have mentioned it. How about a
   Batman squirt gun?

   Sheldon: Don’t try and trick me into buying something I don’t
   want. Now let’s talk Aquaman.

   Howard: What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus’s mind
   in Spider-Man’s body?

   Raj: Well, I’ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the
   superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching
   shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and
   Lohan.

   Howard: Both versions: original and Lohan. You’re an idiot.

   Raj: Hey, what’s your problem?

   Howard: I’m sorry, I’ve been kind of snippy lately. It’s
   probably this stupid diet I’m on.

   Raj: Why are you on a diet?

   Howard: I’ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in
   the men’s section.

   Raj: Well, we’ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was
   bound to come home to roost.

   Sheldon: Twelve hundred dollars. That’s my final offer.

   Stuart: All right, Sheldon, you win. I’m sure Leonard is gonna
   love this.

   Sheldon: Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in
   that squirt gun.

   Stuart: Ooh, yeah, I don’t know. This squirt gun, it’s, uh,
   it’s pretty rare.

   Sheldon: Oh.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.

   Penny: Ah.

   Leonard: And, oh, that’s me getting rescued after I fell in.

   Penny: Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that’s the pizza.

   Leonard: Yep. Here’s some money.

   Penny: Thank you.

   Leonard: And I’m gonna hit the head. That’s what us salty sea
   dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.

   Penny: Hey.

   Pizza guy: Twenty-two fifty.

   Penny: Okay, here’s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.

   Pizza guy: Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of
   stairs.

   Penny: Oh. Okay. Well, here’s, um, thirty something cents and a
   promise I won’t call your boss and tell him you reek of
   marijuana.

   Sheldon: Oh, Penny, I see you’ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese
   food.

   Penny: That’s nice.

   Sheldon: Oh, that’s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to
   wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before
   Leonard returns.

   Penny: Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone
   tonight, so…

   Sheldon: Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese
   noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a
   re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian
   explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.

   Penny: Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes)
   Have a good night!

   Sheldon: What, now, do you have company?

   Penny: No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet’s been doing
   that. I called the building manager, so…

   Sheldon: Oh, I can take a look at it.

   Penny: Well…

   Sheldon: I’m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I
   spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.

   Penny: Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it’s okay. You
   don’t have to go into the bathroom.

   Sheldon: That’s curious. If there’s no one here, why are there
   two glasses of wine on the table?

   Penny: Oh. Well, you know, I, I’ve got two hands and a bit of a
   drinking problem.

   Sheldon: Of course. Ask a silly question.

   Penny: Oh.

   Sheldon: That’s odd.

   Penny: Um, what?

   Sheldon: There are takeout containers in the trash can.

   Penny: So? That’s my dinner from last night.

   Sheldon: What’s odd is they’re in the trash can.

   Penny: Okay. Look, honey, I promise there’s no one’s here. I‘ve
   had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.

   Sheldon: Oh, very well. I’m no stranger to enjoying the
   pleasures of solitude. Oh!

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred
   dollar squirt gun?

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: Hi, honey.

   Howard: Hey.

   Bernadette: I made some brownies. You want one?

   Howard: You’re kidding, right? I mean, you know I’m trying to
   lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.

   Bernadette: We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you’re not
   fat.

   Howard: Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ’cause one of
   you is lying.

   Bernadette: Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom’s?

   Howard: Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.

   Bernadette: Why can’t she do it?

   Howard: ‘Cause we’ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which
   reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from
   work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn’t
   take into account the square footage of her back.

   Bernadette: Let me see. How long have you been putting this on
   her?

   Howard: I don’t know. Few weeks. Why?

   Bernadette: This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell
   me you’ve been wearing gloves.

   Howard: Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.

   Bernadette: Howie, the oestrogen’s getting absorbed by your
   skin. That’s why you’ve been all bloated and moody and a giant
   pain in the ass.

   Howard: You’re full of oestrogen and you don’t act like that.

   Bernadette: That’s ’cause I’m a woman. I’ve had years of
   practice riding the dragon.

   Howard: Fine. I’ll wear gloves next time.

   Bernadette: It’s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones
   to leave your system.

   Howard: I feel so stupid. And fat.

   Bernadette: It’s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why
   don’t we go in the bedroom and I’ll prove it to you?

   Howard: Sex? Really? I mean, that’s just your solution to
   everything.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: Oh, and here’s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there
   are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is
   a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is
   spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you’re not even listening
   to the rules of my made-up language.

   Sheldon: Yes, I am.

   Amy: Then what does tweepadock mean?

   Sheldon: Uh, elephant?

   Amy: Lucky guess.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. I’m just distracted by something that
   happened over at Penny’s.

   Amy: What happened?

   Sheldon: I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.

   Amy: What?

   Sheldon: She claimed to be alone when there was obviously
   someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume
   the worst, given Leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously
   ravenous nether regions.

   Amy: I don’t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.

   Sheldon: Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She
   clapped really loud and made me blink. It’s a small leap from
   there to sexual infidelity.

   Amy: You’re being ridiculous.

   Sheldon: Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash
   can.

   Amy: Poor Leonard.

   Scene: Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny’s door.

   Amy: Do you hear anything?

   Sheldon: I hear a woman’s voice.

   Amy: Is it Penny?

   Sheldon: No, it’s you. All right, I hear whispering and
   giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.

   Amy: Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.

   Sheldon: There’s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.

   Amy: Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.

   Sheldon: Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste
   his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his
   best buddy? Yeah, that’s it. I’m catching her in the act.
   (Unlocks door)

   Amy: No, Sheldon, don’t.

   Sheldon: Aha.

   Penny: What the hell?

   Sheldon: Leonard?

   Penny: Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that.

   Sheldon: Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.
   (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are
   you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha
   again?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: I’m sorry, Sheldon. I should’ve told you I was back. I
   just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to
   what extent our friendship was a burden to you.

   Leonard: That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is
   at least once a month.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, no, let’s not sugarcoat this. You find me
   finicky, pedantic and annoying.

   Penny: No, he doesn’t.

   Leonard: I actually have used those exact words before. In that
   order.

   Sheldon: Well, Leonard, I think it’s high time you and I
   address the tweepadock in the room.

   Leonard: The what?

   Sheldon: Amy?

   Amy: Please leave me out of this.

   Sheldon: Fine. Leonard, there’s no need for you to pretend to
   like me anymore.

   Leonard: Come on, I said I was sorry.

   Sheldon: No, no, you save your apologies for after you’ve had
   disappointing coitus with Penny.

   Penny: It was fine.

   Leonard: Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a
   little present from my trip, huh? It’s that sailor cap that you
   wanted. It’s neat, huh?

   Sheldon: You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with
   a cheap souvenir?

   Leonard: I don’t. I really don’t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.

   Amy: Hello, sailor.

   Penny: Ooh, now we’re talking.

   Sheldon: Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween
   costume I’m wearing this year. Amy, you’re going to be Olive
   Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: Thanks for coming over.

   Raj: No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.

   Howard: Yeah, that’s cucumber and cream cheese. That’s turkey
   and loganberry. And don’t tell my hips, but I’m warming up a
   brie in the oven.

   Raj: Nice. So, mmm. What’s up?

   Howard: Okay, well, I’ve been reading up on all the side
   effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be
   honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?

   Raj: Well, it’s kind of hard to tell.

   Howard: Come on, Raj, it’s a yes or no question.

   Raj: I’m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let’s see if
   they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can’t tell, uh, oh, you know
   what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.

   Howard: Seriously?

   Raj: Do you want my help or not?

   Howard: Fine.

   Raj: Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks
   like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do
   it, mine do the same thing.

   Howard: Yeah, they kind of do.

   Raj: Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)

   Howard: Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.

   Raj: Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind
   them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe.

   Howard: Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size.

   Raj: You know, but, but they’re very firm, so you’ve got that
   going for you.

   Howard: You think?

   Raj: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.

   Howard: Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.
   (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie’s ready.

   Raj: Yay.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Good morning.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Leonard: So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at
   me?

   Sheldon: I’d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to
   work.

   Leonard: Where do you think I would take you?

   Sheldon: Who knows? Uh, you said you’d be home yesterday, but
   you came home three days ago. You say you’re taking me to work,
   but for all I know, I’ll end up in a deserted amusement park.
   Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.

   Leonard: I’m going to work. You can come if you want.

   Sheldon: Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.

   Leonard: No, I don’t.

   Sheldon: Hurts, doesn’t it? You know, I find myself wondering
   if anything you’ve ever told me is true.

   Leonard: I didn’t make it back. The ship sank, I’m in hell.

   Sheldon: You say you’re from New Jersey, but how can I believe
   you?

   Leonard: Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they
   weren’t?

   Sheldon: All right, I’ll give you that one.

   Leonard: Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from
   me?

   Sheldon: I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.

   Leonard: Fine. What I did was wrong.

   Sheldon: I wish I could believe you.

   Leonard: You know what? I’m not driving you to work, because
   you’re incredibly annoying.

   Sheldon: You say one thing and do the other, so then you are
   driving me and you find me a delight.

   Leonard: Stop it.

   Sheldon: Keep it up?

   Leonard: Bye.

   Sheldon: Hello. So I guess you’re really holding up the other
   four fingers?

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Penny: Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?

   Amy: Driving Sheldon to work.

   Penny: He’s still mad at Leonard, huh?

   Amy: Well, he’s mad at you, too. He says you’re the succubus
   who led his friend astray.

   Penny: I don’t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so
   that can’t be good.

   Sheldon: Thought I heard you out here.

   Penny: Hey, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You don’t get a hey. You get a hmm.

   Penny: Come on, don’t be like that. We had so much fun together
   the last couple of months.

   Sheldon: You’re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more
   devastating.

   Penny: Sheldon.

   Sheldon: I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my
   supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons
   I’m going to get in the mail now?

   Amy: Sheldon, your fight’s with Leonard. Penny’s got nothing to
   do…

   Sheldon: Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy’s girlfriend is
   my enemy.

   Amy: Really?

   Sheldon: Yes. You’re either with me or against me.

   Amy: You want to take the bus to work?

   Sheldon: Maybe there’s a third option.

   Amy: FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: So now we’re just waiting for the data from the ship
   to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.

   Howard: That’s so great. If you guys prove the existence of
   Unruh radiation… Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.

   Sheldon: Howard, Raj. Judas.

   Leonard: You know what? You’re a crazy person.

   Sheldon: A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes
   according to plan, a robot army.

   Howard: Stop it.

   Sheldon: Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter
   goes.

   Howard: I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren’t just
   friends. You’re best friends. And that’s a beautiful thing. I
   mean, Leonard, you know why he’s so mad at you? It’s ’cause he
   missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has
   love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other
   day and I love him for it.

   Raj: A little loud, dude.

   Howard: So, can we please put aside these petty differences and
   just be glad we’re here together?

   Leonard: Okay.

   Sheldon: I suppose so.

   Howard: Thank you.

   Raj: Uh, it wasn’t anything weird. It was just to see how big
   they were.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: And then Leonard took me to the barber and the
   dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles
   Bureau of Weights and Measures.

   Leonard: I thought the measures were going to be the stars of
   the show, turns out it was the weights.

   Penny: I’m so glad you guys are friends again.

   Sheldon: And I’m glad you and I are friends again, too.

   Penny: Aw.

   Sheldon: Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want
   you to have it.

   Penny: Fifty cents off Vagisil.

   Sheldon: Think of me when you apply it.

   Raj: Uh, can I just say, I’ve missed all of us hanging out
   together.

   Sheldon: Yeah.

   Penny: Me, too.


   Leonard: Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the
   girls without a beer?


   Bernadette: Oh, that happened right after you left.


   Leonard: And no one told me?


   Howard (crying): Can’t believe we forgot to tell him.


   Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon): Think of Sheldon
   when you apply it.
