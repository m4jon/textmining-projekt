Series 8 Episode 04 – The Hook-Up Reverbration

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: Have you guys heard about this research team that’s
   trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some
   sort of chicken dinosaur?

   Sheldon: Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.

   Howard: What? You’re afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.

   Sheldon: Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich
   wouldn’t hit the Mesozoic spot.

   Raj: Hey, guys.

   Howard: Hey.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Raj: We still on for tomorrow night?

   Leonard: Yeah. I’m excited to finally meet your girlfriend.

   Sheldon: Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of
   Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic
   partner, that person loses one or two close friends.

   Howard: Since when do you read social science?

   Sheldon: I go to the bathroom like everybody else.

   Raj: Why would I lose friends just because I started dating
   someone?

   Leonard: Yeah, you didn’t lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah,
   well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I
   would categorize the two of us.

   Raj: You guys kiss and hold hands.

   Leonard: I’ve seen him do it. It’s not romantic.

   Raj: Look, I’m not the kind of guy who drops his friends just
   because he’s in a relationship.

   Leonard: What happens if she doesn’t like us?

   Raj: Well, hey, you’re my dear friends. You’ll get a Christmas
   card for a couple of years, and then you’re dead to me.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?

   Howard: I don’t want to talk about it.

   Bernadette: But he’s going to.

   Howard: My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in
   that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had
   my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.

   Bernadette: Long story short, they have seven HBOs.

   Raj: Hey, guys.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Raj: Emily, you know almost everybody here.

   Emily: Hi.

   Raj: And this is Leonard, this is Penny.

   Emily: Oh, it’s so nice to meet you.

   Leonard: Nice to finally meet you, too.

   Penny: Hi.

   Emily: Hello.

   Leonard: Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.

   Raj: I told you she exists.

   Penny: Hey, I hear you’re a dermatologist.

   Emily: Uh, yeah, I’m a resident at Huntington Hospital.

   Sheldon: Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it
   turns out you don’t have Dengue fever, they still let you take
   a lollipop.

   Bernadette: You know, Penny just started training to be a
   pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some
   time.

   Penny: Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.

   Emily: Yeah. I’m sure that’d be fine.

   Sheldon: I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an
   appointment for you to look at them?

   Emily: Um, okay, I guess.

   Amy: I’m with him three years, nothing. She’s with him two
   minutes, and he’s taking his pants off.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Bernadette: Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?

   Penny: I don’t know. I kind of got the sense she didn’t like
   me.

   Bernadette: Did she say she didn’t like you?

   Penny: Of course not. No one ever says they don’t like you
   straight to your face.

   Amy: We have led different lives.

   Bernadette: You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?

   Penny: It’s just this vibe I got.

   Bernadette: I’m sure you’re worried about nothing.

   Penny: Yeah. You’re probably right. I used to think my high
   school P.E. teacher didn’t like me, but it turned out, she
   liked me a little too much.

   Bernadette: Really?

   Penny: Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge
   concert, I got an A, it all worked out.

   Bernadette: When you go to Emily’s office to practice, you’ll
   see. It’s fine.

   Penny: Yeah, I hope you’re right.

   Amy: You really went your entire life without anyone saying I
   hate you to your face?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Amy: I’d say it now, but look at those cheekbones.

   Scene: Capital Comics.

   Sheldon: I miss Stuart’s place. All this loud music and exposed
   brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third
   little pig’s house?

   Howard: Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place,
   too.

   Leonard: Okay, him I believe because he’s an 80-year-old man in
   a 15-year-old’s tee shirt. But you’re just upset about Stuart
   and your mom and all their HBOs.

   Howard: Yes, I am. You know, I can’t even watch Game of Thrones
   now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is
   Thrones?

   Raj: You know, he might not reopen. He didn’t get a lot of
   money from the insurance company.

   Sheldon: Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it’s
   those dad-gum insurance companies.

   Leonard: Why? Because they won’t get off your lawn? Is Stuart
   trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?

   Howard: All I know is, he’s got my mother buying four-ply
   toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why
   doesn’t he just use an angora rabbit?

   Sheldon: For starters, they shed and bite.

   Leonard: Hey, here’s a thought. Why don’t we put up the rest of
   the money that Stuart needs?

   Raj: So, we’d be, like, owners of a comic book store?

   Leonard: It’s kind of a dream come true.

   Howard: That does sound fun.

   Raj: Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to
   compete with this place.

   Sheldon: I’ll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic
   book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives
   you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money
   in.

   Leonard: It’s not that bad.

   Scene: Emily’s surgery.

   Penny: Hey.

   Emily: Hi.

   Penny: Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch
   on you. I really appreciate it.

   Emily: Sure.

   Penny: Um, I brought coffee. I wasn’t sure what you like, so I
   got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj,
   I thought you might be into that.

   Emily: Thanks. If we could get started. I’m a little busy.

   Penny: Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials.
   Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in
   high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him
   with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth
   control pill, Femevra.

   Emily: Great.

   Penny: So, Femevra’s triphasic design provides balanced
   hormonal exposure.

   Emily: All right.

   Penny: It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side
   effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause
   acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness
   as a contraceptive.

   Emily: Funny.

   Penny: Okay, I’m sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot?
   Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might
   have a problem with me.

   Emily: No, it’s fine.

   Penny: Are you sure, because it doesn’t seem fine?

   Emily: Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a
   problem.

   Penny: Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?

   Emily: Look, it’s nothing. It’s just, Raj told me that a while
   ago, you two hooked up.

   Penny: What? Oh, why would he say that?

   Emily: Did it not happen?

   Penny: Well, I wouldn’t exactly call it a hook-up.

   Emily: Did you kiss?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Emily: Were you naked?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Emily: So, it was a hook-up.

   Penny: No. Yeah.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: So, what are some ways we could set our comic book
   store apart from the competition?

   Leonard: Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure
   out a way to get more kids in the store.

   Howard: You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I
   could never get a ride.

   Raj: Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids
   up?

   Sheldon: Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?

   Howard: Toy stores, puppet shows.

   Leonard: Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the
   streets looking for kids to pick up?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Leonard: And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?

   Raj: We are now.

   Penny: You told Emily we hooked up?

   Raj: Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.

   Penny: Why would you say that?

   Raj: We were having a conversation about past lovers.

   Penny: We weren’t lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn’t
   sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn’t
   you just leave me out of it?

   Raj: Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the
   conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?

   Leonard: Why say it?

   Penny: Yes.

   Raj: Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just
   because, without you, we’re playing fast and loose with the
   word list.

   Penny: Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.

   Raj: Great.

   Sheldon: On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One
   friend down. I wonder who you’re going to lose next.

   Raj: You, okay? It’s you. You’re, you’re next.

   Sheldon: No. You’re crazy about me.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: I don’t know what Emily’s so upset about anyway. Even if
   I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.

   Amy: Hmm-hmm.

   Penny: Almost everyone has a past.

   Bernadette: Come on, look how pretty you are. I’m sure this
   isn’t the first girl to hate you.

   Penny: It’s not.

   Bernadette: And I’m sure you can turn it around.

   Penny: How? You can’t force someone to like you.

   Amy: What if you just hang around and act like her friend until
   you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you’re in her
   home, you’re eating her food, drinking her wine.

   Penny: No, that won’t work.

   Amy: You’re right. Cheers.

   Bernadette: Oh, I know. Why don’t you use your sales training
   to go back down there and sell yourself?

   Penny: What?

   Bernadette: Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you’d be
   selling Penny. it’s cute.

   Penny: It’s stupid.

   Bernadette: Well, maybe people would like you more if you
   didn’t crap all over their ideas.

   Amy: I’m gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why
   wouldn’t I? I mean, we go way back.

   Penny: Oh, my God. I didn’t used to like you.

   Amy: Shh. Amy’s here now.

   Scene: Capital Comics.

   Sheldon: You know, the more I think about it, the more
   intrigued I am about having our own store.

   Howard: We’ll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the
   shelves.

   Sheldon: And we’ll get to have fun interactions with our
   customers. Like, this isn’t a library, buy it or get out.

   Howard: You say things like that all the time.

   Sheldon: Yes, but as a store owner, I’ll finally have a good
   comeback to, You don’t work here, shut up.

   Leonard: Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left
   her off his list?

   Howard: Yeah.

   Leonard: Well, do you think when she and I had that
   conversation, she left people off her list?

   Sheldon: I’m sure she did.

   Leonard: Why?

   Sheldon: Because if she hadn’t, she’d still be wading through
   the list.

   Leonard: Will you stay out of this?

   Sheldon: If only Penny had said that once in a while.

   Howard: Hey, what difference does it make? You’re the one she
   wants to marry.

   Leonard: That’s true.

   Howard: Yeah, and I’m not sure that complete honesty is always
   the best thing for a relationship.

   Sheldon: Yeah, he’s right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told
   Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill.
   She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing
   Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.

   Leonard: Why are you even part of this conversation? You don’t
   know anything about women.

   Sheldon: I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée, I’d ask her
   first before I invested money in a comic book store.

   Howard: He’s right.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her
   hair. It did everything but quack.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Leonard: There’s something I wanted to run past you.

   Penny: What’s up?

   Leonard: Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in
   Stuart’s comic book store. Is that okay?

   Penny: Why are you asking me?

   Leonard: Well, you know, we’re engaged, and it’s kind of a big
   deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.

   Penny: Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt
   kind of a big deal financially?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: Huh.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great
   investment opportunity.

   Bernadette: Nope.

   Howard: But you didn’t hear what it was.

   Bernadette: I know.

   Howard: Oh, come on.

   Bernadette: Fine. What is it?

   Howard: It’s to help reopen the comic book store.

   Bernadette: Nope.

   Howard: Well, hear me out.

   Bernadette: Howard, you know we’re saving up for a house.

   Howard: I know, but all the guys are doing it. We’re splitting
   it four ways, so it’s really not that much money.

   Bernadette: It just seems like a risky investment.

   Howard: I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is
   important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take
   me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did
   together.

   Bernadette: Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

   Howard: Well, I don’t like to talk about it.

   Bernadette: Oh, baby. That story’s made up, isn’t it?

   Howard: That’s how much buying a comic book store means to me.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I’d like your honest opinion on something.

   Amy: Of course.

   Sheldon: Now, before I start, I need you to know that I’m very
   excited about this, and anything you say that isn’t
   enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship
   into question. So, keep an open mind.

   Amy: I’m feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Perfect. Now, I’m considering investing in Stuart’s
   comic book store.

   Amy: Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished
   scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books
   about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both
   his financial and intellectual resources?

   Sheldon: No.

   Amy: Then I think it’s a terrific idea.

   Sheldon: Great. Wait till you hear about our van.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Raj: Hey.

   Penny: Hi.

   Raj: Thanks for inviting us over.

   Penny: Oh, thank you for coming.

   Emily: Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to
   apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.

   Penny: No, no. No need to apologise.

   Raj: Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys,
   and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a
   friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?

   Penny: Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me
   and Raj was a long time ago.

   Raj: It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal
   than I should have.

   Penny: Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I’m just
   hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.

   Emily: Mm. I’d like that, too. Yeah, I thought I’d be okay with
   it, but then I saw how pretty you are.

   Penny: Oh, that’s so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are
   gorgeous.

   Raj: It’s true, you’re both gorgeous. Kind of says something
   about the man who could bed you both. You get why I’ve been
   alone most of my adult life.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Stuart: So, what brings you by?

   Howard: Well, I don’t need a reason, it’s my house.

   Stuart: Technically, it’s your mom’s house, but we certainly
   want you to feel welcome.

   Howard: I’m always welcome.

   Stuart: Mm, just try and call first.

   Bernadette: Okay, let’s get down to business. Howie was
   thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the
   store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.

   Stuart: Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother
   already gave me the money.

   Howard: What?

   Stuart: Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was
   happy to help out her bubala.

   Howard: Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and
   Stuart is not your bubala, I’m your bubala. You can’t have more
   than one bubala.

   Stuart: I don’t know who he’s talking to. She’s at Target,
   buying me shirts.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Raj: I’m so glad we could work this all out.

   Penny: Yeah, me, too.

   Emily: You know, we should have dinner one night with you and
   Leonard.

   Penny: Oh, we would love that.

   Raj: Great.

   Penny: Okay, good night, guys.

   Emily: All right, night.

   Penny: Bye.

   Emily and Penny (simultaneously): I hate her.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: I’m really disappointed we’re not gonna have our own comic
   book store.

   Leonard: I know. I was looking forward to it.

   Sheldon: It would’ve been so nice to have a place that was
   ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.

   Howard: With comfy seats.

   Raj: And snacks.

   Sheldon: Well, I guess it was too good to be true.

   Leonard: Yeah.
