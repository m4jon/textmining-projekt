Series 6 Episode 20 – The Tenure Turbulence

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies.
   Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up
   again.

   Howard: We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to
   an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver
   proved us all wrong.

   Leonard: My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it
   is real.

   Raj: Only if you’re this jellyfish which periodically reverts
   to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.

   Sheldon: If I could keep my Gmail account, I’d be okay with
   that.

   Barry: – Hewwo, fewwas.

   All: Hey.

   Barry: Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that
   smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman’s office was?

   Howard: Yeah?

   Barry: Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two
   weeks.

   Howard: That’s terrible.

   Leonard: Oh, my God.

   Barry: In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that
   evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.

   Sheldon: If we’re going to change the topic from jellyfish, I’d
   be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.

   Howard: Show a little compassion, a man died.

   Barry: And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit
   awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the
   knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose
   to do the watter.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A
   guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become
   complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should
   have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say
   something stupid.

   Raj: Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel
   safe and secure.

   Sheldon: Pchew!

   Barry: If you need my nose, you’ll find it firmwy wodged up the
   qectum of the tenure committee.

   Howard: You Ph.D’s gonna go suck up like Kripke?

   Leonard: No. I mean, I’ll apply, but I’m not gonna stoop to
   playing politics.

   Raj: Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I
   can’t get tenure, I’d like to see you or Sheldon get it.

   Sheldon: Raj, don’t dangle false hope in front of Leonard like
   that.

   Leonard: Excuse me, but I think I’m just as qualified as you
   are.

   Sheldon: Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So tenured means a job for life?

   Leonard: Yup.

   Penny: You can’t get fired even if you’re bad at it?

   Leonard: Mm, not really.

   Penny: Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the
   Cheesecake Factory.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they
   gave it to me, it wouldn’t diminish my output. You know, I’m
   like the sun. Can’t turn this off.

   Amy: Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?

   Sheldon: Mm-hmm.

   Amy: Do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so
   great?

   Sheldon: Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on
   this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you
   worship me really keep you in the running.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Raj: It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking
   money from my parents.

   Howard: Money from family does come with strings attached.

   Raj: You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday
   but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm
   butt, you’re gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I
   will, old man.

   Bernadette: I think that’s enough wine for now.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I
   called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.

   Penny: She’d be proud, huh?

   Leonard: Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: My primary concern with being granted tenure is living
   with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need
   to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.

   Amy: Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability
   and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.

   Sheldon: Or, the chainsaw.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Raj: And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled
   white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant’s
   back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.

   Bernadette: I’m gonna make some coffee.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?

   Leonard: I’m not gonna schmooze anybody. I’m gonna let my work
   speak for itself.

   Penny: That’s great. That shows a lot of integrity.

   Leonard: Thank you. I’m a naive idiot, right?

   Penny: Oh, good, you heard me.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy
   up to the people making the decision.

   Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.

   Amy: You don’t say.

   Sheldon: But I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to know who’s on the
   committee. Let’s see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.

   Amy: Is that a problem?

   Sheldon: Well…

   (Flashback to Series 6, Episode 12, The Egg Salad Equivalency)

   Sheldon: Even you. You’re a slave.

   Janine: I’m a what?

   (End of flashback)

   Sheldon: I’m not sure, it could go either way.

   Scene: The university gymnasium.

   Leonard: Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.

   Janine: Hey.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Janine: Dr. Hofstadter.

   Leonard: Yeah. Just thought I’d come down and start getting
   ready for swimsuit season.

   Janine: Good for you.

   Leonard: Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a
   swimsuit.

   Janine: Thank you.

   Leonard: I’ve got what my father used to call furniture
   disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I’m not, uh,
   familiar with this model. How do I make it start?

   Janine: You push start.

   Leonard: Right. This one might be broken.

   Janine: You have to move.

   Leonard: Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I’m feeling it.
   Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life.
   Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your
   life, uh, did I read that you’re on that-that tenure committee?

   Janine: Yep. I got to get a home gym.

   Leonard: Well, I’m sure you have a lot of good applicants, I
   just wanted to say hi and let you know that I’ll be throwing my
   hat in the ring.

   Janine: All right, I’ll keep an eye out for that.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Barry: Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first
   time in… ever.

   Leonard: Go away.

   Barry: Janine the Machine, wet’s do this!

   Janine: Hey, Barry.

   Leonard: Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.

   Barry: I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead
   I baked you.

   Janine: Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.

   Barry: No, my pweasure.

   Leonard: Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I’ve got a-a
   great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I’ll e-mail it
   to you.

   Barry: Aw wight, I’m warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?

   Janine: Let’s go.

   Leonard: That’s enough cardio for me. I’m just gonna stretch
   out before I hit the weights.

   Janine: You okay?

   Leonard: Call someone.

   Scene: Janine’s office. There is a sound on her computer. It
   opens up an online video.

   Raj: Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from
   the astrophysics department. Don’t be alarmed, I’m not really
   in space. Anyhoo, I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you
   about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following
   90-minute video.

   Janine: Oh, come on.

   Raj: Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant
   gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of
   five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to
   be the moon.

   Shelldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock,
   knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis?

   Janine: God, they’re everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I
   help you?

   Sheldon: Yes, hello. I’m fine. Um, I understand you may have a
   bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.

   Janine: Uh, Dr. Cooper, that’s not necessary.

   Sheldon: It’s too late. Get ready to like me.

   Janine: Roots?

   Sheldon: The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the
   whole family.

   Janine: Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?

   Sheldon: Um… Well… You are black, right?

   Janine: This meeting has come to an end.

   Sheldon: Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy
   that. Let’s see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor
   Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: Gentlemen.

   Raj: Where have you been?

   Leonard: Nurse’s office.

   Howard: Asthma attack?

   Leonard: Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. I’m fine, though.

   Howard: You guys going to Professor Tupperman’s memorial?

   Raj: I don’t know.

   Leonard: Probably not.

   Sheldon: Barely knew him.

   Howard: Yeah, you wouldn’t want to look like you guys are
   brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh,
   yeah, that’s what I was hoping for, meerkats.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I won’t be able to make our date night this Thursday,
   so, bad news for you.

   Amy: Well you better have a good excuse this time, because
   trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.

   Sheldon: First of all, when you say things like that, people
   think you’re crazy. Second, the reason I’m cancelling is
   because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor
   Tupperman.

   Amy: It sounds like a long and tedious evening.

   Sheldon: Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and
   tedious evening, I’d rather it be with you on date night. But I
   have no choice. The tenure committee’s going to be there.

   Amy: Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.

   Sheldon: Well, now that I think about it, that would be most
   helpful.

   Amy: Of course it would. I’m well-versed in academic politics,
   and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a
   candidate.

   Sheldon: Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes
   you happy, that other stuff, too.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: Do anything interesting today?

   Penny: Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted
   me to help her find something for this memorial thing.

   Leonard: Wait, Sheldon’s going to be there? We all promised we
   weren’t going to go.

   Penny: Oh, what a jerk.

   Leonard: I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.

   Penny: Well, since Amy’s going, do you want me there? You know,
   to support you?

   Leonard: Oh, that’s nice, but it-it’s just gonna be a room full
   of boring old men and I’m not sure how much help you’d be.

   Penny: Okay. I’m just gonna tie my shoe while you think about
   that.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You
   realize you might kill some of them.

   Penny: Oh, then you all can get tenure.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj: Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat
   warmers. This is so humiliating. I’ve got to get tenure. Okay,
   let’s meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to
   twice a week? Looks like we’re both going to be living like
   animals.

   Scene: The memorial.

   Amy: Let’s go over our emotional responses one last time.

   Sheldon: Okay.

   Amy: Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?

   Sheldon: Sad.

   Amy: The fact that there are so many people here tonight
   doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?

   Sheldon: Glad.

   Amy: Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?

   Sheldon: Bad. However…

   Amy: No.

   Sheldon: Fine. Bad.

   Raj: Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to
   schmooze with the tenure committee.

   Sheldon: You’re here.

   Raj: Excuse me. I’m here to pay my respects to Professor
   Tupperware, or whatever his name is.

   Sheldon: So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.

   Leonard: Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I
   guess the train store in Glendale wasn’t having a cotillion
   after all. And you, you said you weren’t coming here, either.

   Raj: I have a thick accent. You don’t know what I said.

   Amy: I’d like to know why Penny’s here.

   Penny: I’m here to support my man, just like you.

   Sheldon: What are you going to do? Take people’s drink orders
   and get them wrong?

   Leonard: Do it.

   Sheldon: What? Did she do it yet?

   Amy: She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee
   to further Leonard’s cause.

   Sheldon: Well, that’s a fine how-do-you-do. Don’t just stand
   there. Take your breasts out.

   Howard: Ooh, meerkat fight!

   Amy: You’re all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most
   qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom’s
   going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are
   they staying up like that?

   Leonard: Way to hit ’em with both barrels.

   Raj: You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to
   advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on
   doing.

   Sheldon: Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality
   to exploit?

   Raj: Yes.

   Sheldon: Okay, because that was not clear.

   Amy: Sheldon!

   Sheldon: What? That was ambiguous.

   Raj: Well, now it’s biguous. What are you gonna do about it?

   Sheldon: Um…

   Howard: You could talk some smack about his mother.

   Sheldon: Well, yes, of course, he wouldn’t like that at all.
   Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I
   happened to come across your mother.

   Leonard: Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?

   Sheldon: I don’t know what you’re doing, but I was about to
   insinuate that I had coitus with Raj’s mother for a dollar.

   Leonard: Oh, you do what you want, but I don’t want to lose my
   friends over tenure. Friends are forever.

   Howard: So is tenure.

   Bernadette: Walk.

   Leonard: I’m just gonna go home and let my work speak for
   itself.

   Raj: You’re right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last
   night.

   Leonard: How about it, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: What do you think I should do?

   Amy: Well, you’ll always be an academic success, but I
   seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends.

   Sheldon: I don’t want any more, but let’s go.

   Barry: Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.

   Janine: I could not ask you to do that.

   Barry: Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just
   makes them waugh and waugh.

   Leonard: No. We cannot lose to that jerk.

   Raj: Yeah, screw it. I’m going in.

   Sheldon: Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I’m going in is
   what I said to your mother last night. Don’t worry, I didn’t
   really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and
   off-putting.

   Amy: Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.

   Scene: Janine’s office.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock)
   Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? I know you’re in
   there. I saw your car in the parking lot.

   Janine: What?

   Sheldon: I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr.
   Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for
   tenure.

   Janine: Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very
   accomplished in your respective fields.

   Sheldon: I don’t know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do
   want to express my gratitude.

   Janine: You didn’t bring another gift, did you?

   Sheldon: No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was
   inappropriate.

   Janine: Good.

   Sheldon: Anyway, thank you.

   Janine: You’re welcome. (Sheldon attempts a jive handshake) I’m
   gonna pretend that didn’t happen.

   Sheldon: Yeah, right on, sister.
