Series 7 Episode 18 – The Mommy Observation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: Should you really be sitting in Sheldon’s spot?

   Raj: He’s in Texas, he’ll never know.

   Penny: I wouldn’t be so sure about that.

   Leonard: Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it’s true.
   Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.

   Raj: Have you heard from Howard?

   Bernadette: I did. His talk at NASA went great.

   Penny: Sheldon didn’t heckle him?

   Bernadette: No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought
   him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.

   Stuart: Hey, guys.

   Amy: Oh, hi.

   Bernadette: Hi, Stuart.

   Raj: Hey, Stuart!

   Stuart: How’s it going?

   Raj: Good. Sheldon’s out of town, so we can do whatever we
   want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn’t like.

   Stuart: Oh, how is it?

   Penny: Disgusting. Do not tell him.

   Leonard: What do you guys want to do tonight?

   Amy: I don’t know.

   Bernadette: Well, I told Howie if I wasn’t busy, I’d spend the
   night at his mom’s. So for God’s sake, think of something.

   Raj: Stuart? Are you okay?

   Stuart: No, I don’t feel so…

   Leonard: Oh, my God, Stuart?

   Penny: Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!

   Raj: Stuart?

   Leonard: Calling 911.

   Raj: Well, it’s too late.

   Leonard: What do you mean it’s too late?

   Raj: He’s been murdered by someone in this room.

   Penny: Oh, my God.

   Leonard: Oh, come on.

   Raj: Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery
   dinner.

   Amy: I’m leaving.

   Raj: You can’t leave. You’re a suspect in the mysterious murder
   of Stuart Bloom.

   Bernadette: I didn’t know his last name was Bloom.

   Amy: Yeah, it’s Bloom.

   Penny: Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be
   dead all night?

   Stuart: What do you think I was gonna do at home?

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame
   characters with silly accents?

   Raj: Lame characters with silly ac…, what kind of actress are
   you?

   Penny: You’re right, I’m sorry. Sounds like fun.

   Raj: Thank you.

   Penny: That kind of actress. This sucks.

   Leonard: Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And
   that’s great. It’s not sad, it’s great.

   Amy: I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.

   Raj: Actually, you’re all just gonna be yourselves.

   Amy: Oh, ugh.

   Bernadette: All right, if I’m doing this, I’m playing to win,
   so just to be clear, if we’re ourselves, that means one of us
   killed Stuart?

   Raj: Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.

   Bernadette: What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?

   Raj: Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?

   Amy: According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.

   Raj: Great, everyone’s a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some
   secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the
   murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other
   questions to uncover clues.

   Penny: Got it. Hey, who’s the murderer?

   Raj: Any question but that.

   Penny: Sorry. Hey, who’s not the murderer?

   Stuart: Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?

   Bernadette: What do you care? You’re dead.

   Stuart: Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.

   Scene: A hire car.

   Sheldon: Thank you for my bobble head.

   Howard: Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.

   Sheldon: It wasn’t easy. Was it Buzz?

   Howard: We can’t show up to your mom’s empty-handed. We should
   bring something.

   Sheldon: I already am. I’m bringing the gift of knowledge.

   Howard: Oh, boy.

   Sheldon: Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological
   studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old
   Testament, they didn’t exist in the Middle East until hundreds
   of years later.

   Howard: I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an
   insult to her faith is always thoughtful.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Bernadette: So, what happens next?

   Raj: I can’t tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a
   fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.

   Penny: Ooh, I’m gonna check the fridge, and see if there are
   any clues inside a beer.

   Amy: Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a
   briefcase.

   Leonard: Oh, no, no. That’s Clarence Darrow. It’s from a game
   Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a
   chute and then work your way back up through the appellate
   system.

   Raj: Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.

   Penny: Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us
   do this stuff?

   Raj: Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in
   India, and didn’t have any friends.

   Bernadette: I didn’t know you were fat.

   Raj: Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle
   school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it
   doesn’t help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely,
   so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised
   myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those
   games with them.

   Amy: That is so sweet.

   Leonard: I’ve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat
   kid.

   Raj: No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a
   flair for storytelling.

   Bernadette: Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.

   Amy: What’s it for?

   Bernadette: For a cup of coffee. But it’s dated 20 years from
   now.

   Raj: From the future? How fun and imaginative.

   Leonard: So one of us came back from the future to murder
   Stuart?

   Raj: Correct.

   Leonard: Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know
   he’s just ripping off Terminator?

   Raj: Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually
   ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a
   Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?

   Leonard: Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan
   Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand,
   but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote
   called The Soldier?

   Penny: I’m gonna need another clue.

   Scene: Sheldon’s childhood home.

   Howard: Okay, give me the flowers and pie.

   Sheldon: But if we show up and you’re holding them, she’ll
   think they’re only from you.

   Howard: They are only from me. You said the gift of you was
   enough.

   Sheldon: Yes, but now that I’ve seen what the gift of me with
   flowers and pie looks like, there’s no going back. Boy, I can’t
   wait to see the look on her face. We’re leaving right now.

   Howard: What’s wrong?

   Sheldon: Nothing.

   Howard: What? Sheldon, tell me what’s going on.

   Sheldon: I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to
   be a mommy again.

   Scene: A bar in Texas.

   Howard: You ready to talk about it?

   Sheldon: I’m not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any
   idea what it’s like to see your mother ravaging someone?

   Howard: Does a brisket count? I’m sorry, buddy, that’s rough.
   But didn’t she know we were coming?

   Sheldon: No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to
   say to her after something like this?

   Howard: Well, did she see you in the window?

   Sheldon: No.

   Howard: Then don’t say anything.

   Sheldon: I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy
   relationship if I don’t tell her how disappointed I am, and
   that I’ll never forgive her?

   Howard: Well, don’t do it on the phone.

   Sheldon: No, I’m just going to tell her I’m coming so she can
   give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.

   Howard: That’s some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.

   Sheldon: Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.

   Howard: Look, she’s a grown woman. And, and your dad’s been
   gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.

   Sheldon: I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And
   if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least
   get a vote.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine
   the killer must’ve used. You’re all inside it, and we hurtle
   through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the
   future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so
   bored.

   Penny: Well, my beer isn’t flat and my rack’s not saggy. So
   far, the future’s great.

   Stuart: Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

   Raj: Fine, just try not to look too alive.

   Stuart: That’s my jam.

   Bernadette: So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?

   Amy: But why?

   Raj: Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about
   yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.

   Amy: Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the
   money to buy Stuart’s comic book store, and close it down so
   Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.

   Penny: Hey, I’m a famous actress living in London.

   Leonard: Hmm, I’m a professor at Stanford.

   Penny: Hmm.

   Bernadette: So I guess you two are making it work long
   distance.

   Raj: Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you
   drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you
   guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still
   flexible, Madonna.

   Amy: What does your card say, Bernadette?

   Leonard: Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we’d really drift
   apart if we both became successful?

   Penny: Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to
   move, you would just come with me.

   Leonard: But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I
   might not have that much choice in where I end up.

   Penny: Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn’t
   need the money.

   Leonard: Well, you don’t go into science for the money.

   Bernadette: Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both
   invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky
   chumps.

   Penny: So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might
   not go?

   Amy: Dun, dun, dun. He started it.

   Raj: Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard,
   you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York.
   Uh, you’re an actress, you’re a professor and you have three
   beautiful kids.

   Leonard: Great.

   Penny: Really? You think I’m putting this body through three
   kids?

   Scene: Sheldon’s childhood home.

   Sheldon: Okay, let’s do this.

   Howard: Good luck.

   Sheldon: You, aren’t you gonna come with me?

   Howard: While you confront your mother about her sex life? I’d
   rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock)
   Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?

   Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m so glad you’re here.

   Sheldon: I saw you having naked sex.

   Mrs Cooper: What are you talking about?

   Sheldon: Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the
   window and I saw you with a man.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly, I’m so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we
   should sit down and talk about this.

   Sheldon: Can you recommend a surface you haven’t had coitus on?

   Mrs Cooper: That’s not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table.
   Well, I’m sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.

   Sheldon: Who was he?

   Mrs Cooper: His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.

   Sheldon: How long have you been involved with him?

   Mrs Cooper: A few months.

   Sheldon: And of those few months, how long have you been a
   demented sex pervert?

   Mrs Cooper: That is no way to speak to your mother.

   Sheldon: Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who
   quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one
   of Ethan Allen’s finest sofas.

   Mrs Cooper: I will give you one opportunity, young man, to
   apologize.

   Sheldon: Or what?

   Mrs Cooper: Or I will send you to your room.

   Sheldon: That’s ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a
   professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high
   ground.

   Mrs Cooper: Go to your room.

   Sheldon: But I occupy the moral high ground.

   Mrs Cooper: Go to your room.

   Sheldon: But I’m a professional scientist.

   Mrs: Go to your room!

   Sheldon: I’m a grown man.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Can we please get back to the game?

   Leonard: In a minute. I don’t understand why any success you
   have in acting is more important than any I have in science.

   Penny: Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might
   change the world. If I become a famous actress, I’m not gonna
   tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.

   Amy: I’m surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.

   Leonard: Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?

   Amy: Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array
   of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability,
   intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human
   race hard.

   Penny: In 20 years, who knows what’ll happen with any of us?

   Stuart: I think you and Leonard will be together.

   Penny: You do?

   Stuart: Yeah. I think you’re the best couple I know.

   Leonard: Aw.

   Penny: That’s so sweet.

   Bernadette: What the hell?

   Amy: Excuse me?

   Penny: Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you
   think that?

   Stuart: Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better.
   Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like
   Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don’t
   know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.

   Penny: Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.

   Raj: Oh, come on.

   Bernadette: Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.

   Scene: Sheldon’s old bedroom.

   Howard: Hey, can I come in?

   Sheldon: Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not
   you? I thought you were waiting in the car.

   Howard: That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a
   house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take
   it things didn’t go smoothly with your mom.

   Sheldon: No. I’m not sure how we’re going to get past this.

   Howard: You know, I, I sort of went through something like this
   myself.

   Sheldon: Howard, we’ve all seen your mother naked. That woman
   needs to learn how to tie a robe.

   Howard: I’m talking about when my mom started seeing someone a
   couple of years after my dad left.

   Sheldon: I didn’t know she did.

   Howard: Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk
   to her about it.

   Sheldon: What did you do?

   Howard: Well, let’s just say it was the most vicious bar
   mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she
   broke up with him. And she’s basically been alone ever since.
   She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. Although, based on your story, you
   absolutely were the reason why.

   Howard: All I’m saying is you might not want to get in the way
   of your mom’s happiness.

   Sheldon: You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she
   fornicates like a demonic weasel.

   Howard: And the healing begins.

   Scene: Mrs Cooper’s living room.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Mrs Cooper: Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like
   adults?

   Sheldon: I am.

   Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I’m sorry that you saw what you saw. I know
   that this is hard for you.

   Sheldon: I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the
   hypocrisy. Doesn’t this contradict all the religious rules
   you’ve been espousing your whole life?

   Mrs Cooper: You’re right, it does, and it’s something that I’m
   struggling with these days.

   Sheldon: Then why are you doing it?

   Mrs Cooper: Because I’m not perfect, Shelly. And that man’s
   booty is.

   Sheldon: Well, this is confusing for me. But I don’t want to
   stand in the way of your happiness. So, I’ll condemn you
   internally while maintaining an outward appearance of
   acceptance.

   Mrs Cooper: That is very Christian of you.

   Sheldon: Mother, if you’re going to conduct your life in this
   fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed
   since you were a young woman. You know, it’s not all sock hops,
   soda jerks and segregation anymore.

   Mrs Cooper: How old do you think I am?

   Sheldon: My point is that you’re going to need to be careful.
   You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology,
   but now you’re going to need a stronger friend named latex.

   Mrs Cooper: Are you having the sex talk with me?

   Sheldon: Well, someone has to.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, dear Lord.

   Sheldon: No, don’t look to Him. He’s mad at you right now.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Oh, come on, don’t pout. I’m sorry I ruined your game.

   Raj: I’m not pouting, I’m brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.

   Amy: It actually was kind of fun.

   Raj: You’re just saying that.

   Amy: Yeah.

   Bernadette: I liked the time travel element.

   Raj: Thank you. I thought it was inspired.

   Leonard: It was. By Terminator.

   Bernadette: Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all
   still together and still friends.

   Penny: Definitely.

   Leonard: Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether we’re
   friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter
   what, let’s all promise to meet in front of this building
   exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like
   we always do.

   Bernadette: Aw.

   Penny: I love it.

   Leonard: Putting it in my phone right now.

   Penny: Yeah, me, too.

   Stuart: My phone doesn’t have a calendar. So I’ll just write it
   on my hand.

   Raj: And it’s done.

   Penny: Yup, we’re all in.

   Leonard: All right, I’ll see you guys in 20 years.

   Scene: In front of the building, 20 years later.

   Stuart: I knew it.
