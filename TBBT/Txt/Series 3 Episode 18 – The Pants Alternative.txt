Series 3 Episode 18 – The Pants Alternative

   Scene: The university cafeteria.

   Raj: Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up
   their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their
   junk.

   Howard: Yeah, so?

   Raj: So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also
   use their ponytails.

   Howard: What’s your point?

   Raj: My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I’d be very
   nervous around James Cameron.

   Sheldon: It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional
   details when there are more important things in the real world
   to worry about. For example, why wasn’t William Shatner in the
   new Star Trek movie?

   Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office,
   and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this
   year’s Chancellor’s Award for Science.

   Sheldon: And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my
   contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William
   Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I’ll play. What
   self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?

   Leonard: Oh, I’m so glad you asked it like that. You.

   Sheldon: I won?

   Leonard: You won.

   Sheldon: I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award,
   no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It’s not
   astonishing, more like inevitable. I’m not sure what to do
   first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I’m going
   to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.

   Raj: Well, good for him.

   Howard: Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical
   physics needed was an ego boost.

   Credits sequence

   Scene: The apartment. The guys are watching Avatar in 3D. All
   are wearing 3D glasses except Raj.

   Howard: Didn’t it look like that spear was going to go right
   through your skull?

   Raj: No.

   Leonard: Hey, you didn’t want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don’t
   get glasses.

   Sheldon (phone rings): Oh, that will be another congratulatory
   call for me. Uh, mute, please.

   Howard: Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.

   Sheldon: Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I
   was expecting your call (aside) three years ago. I see. Wait.
   What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I
   don’t want to forfeit the award? Well, you’ve got that tied up
   in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. (Hangs up) Problem.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I
   can’t give a speech.

   Howard: Well, no, you’re mistaken. You give speeches all the
   time. What you can’t do is shut up.

   Raj: Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why
   guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.

   Sheldon: I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I
   cannot speak to large crowds.

   Leonard: What, to you, is a large crowd?

   Sheldon: Any group big enough to trample me to death. General
   rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.

   Penny: Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from
   work. You know, ’cause of your award, not because a busboy
   sneezed on it.

   Sheldon: I’m not accepting the award.

   Penny: Why not?

   Howard: Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.

   Penny: That’s no reason to back out. You know, I once got a
   pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about
   appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it,
   and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on
   a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn
   Queen’s court.

   Sheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I’ll bear that in mind if I’m ever
   nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you’re being ridiculous.

   Sheldon: Am I? Let me tell you a story.

   Howard: Where’s 70 children when you need ‘em?

   Sheldon: I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college.
   Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.

   Penny: I just love how you always skip over the part where no
   one asks.

   Sheldon: I was valedictorian and expected to give an address.
   Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the
   podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been
   thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I
   began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I
   knew it… oh, dear. (He faints.)

   Penny: Oh, my God.

   Leonard: Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?

   Sheldon: Don’t trample me.

   Scene: The stairwell. Sheldon is on the phone.

   Sheldon: Come on, Mother, you know why I can’t accept the
   award. With all due respect, I don’t think praying will help.
   No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no,
   no, no, no, no, no, you don’t need to start singing it. Yes,
   I’ll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. (Enters
   apartment. The others are sitting as if waiting for him.)
   Hello.

   Leonard: Sit down, we want to talk to you.

   Sheldon: Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?

   Penny: Just sit.

   Leonard: We think we can help you with your stage fright.

   Sheldon: Oh, I doubt that. I haven’t figured out a way, and I’m
   much smarter than all of you.

   Penny: Yes, but you’re not smarter than all of us put together.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m sorry, that is what I meant.

   Penny: Okay, your problem is, you’re trying to do this all by
   yourself.

   Leonard: We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh,
   Professor Xavier and his X-Men.

   Sheldon: I do like the X-Men.

   Penny: Did I see X-Men?

   Leonard: Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.

   Penny: Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it,
   Sheldon?

   Sheldon: I don’t know. If you’re my X-Men, what are your
   powers?

   Penny: Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a
   nice suit. Might give you more confidence.

   Sheldon: That’s not exactly a mutation that would get you into
   Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?

   Leonard: I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the
   root of your anxiety.

   Sheldon: What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?

   Leonard: My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I’ve
   been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding
   co-dependently.

   Howard: Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I
   don’t know, some Indian meditation crap.

   Sheldon: I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set
   the bar so low, you’re saving the most impressive contribution
   for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.

   Howard: My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn
   about your piddly-ass problems. And that’s 24-7, buddy.

   Sheldon: And I appreciate the pretence.

   Penny: So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?

   Sheldon: No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier.
   Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.

   Howard: Oh, that’s not a good name.

   Scene: The apartment. Raj is lighting candles. Indian music is
   playing.

   Raj: Okay, Sheldon. I’m going to be leading you through a
   series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the
   ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own
   fears.

   Sheldon: And yet, you can’t speak to women.

   Raj: True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the
   same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.

   Sheldon: Okay, but don’t punch me.

   Raj: What?

   Sheldon: When I was little, my sister would say to me, close
   your eyes, you’ll get a surprise, and then she’d punch me.

   Raj: I’m not going to punch you.

   Sheldon: That’s what my sister used to say.

   Raj: Do you want to do this or not?

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. Proceed.

   Raj: All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most
   at home. Where is that?

   Sheldon: Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed,
   Sheldonopolis.

   Raj: Okay, you’re in Sheldonopolis.

   Sheldon: Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon
   Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?

   Raj: Whatever you like.

   Sheldon: I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.

   Raj: Fine. You’re in Sheldon Square.

   Sheldon: Really? This time of year? It’s a bit nippy.

   Raj: Then, put on a sweater.

   Sheldon: Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at
   Shel-Mart.

   Raj: Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.

   Sheldon: You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it,
   so I get a 15% discount.

   Raj: You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!

   Sheldon: Look, I didn’t turn a profit last quarter by taking
   product off the shelves willy-nilly.

   Raj: All right. You’ve paid for a sweater, and you’re in
   Sheldon Square.

   Sheldon: Hang on. It’s a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.

   Raj: What now?

   Sheldon: A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I
   have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this
   is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can’t run, leave them
   behind. Oh, the simulated horror! (Sound of door slamming) Raj?
   Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.

   Scene: A clothing store.

   Sheldon: I question your premise. How is a new suit going to
   prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of
   people?

   Penny: It’ll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I’m
   feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a
   cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.

   Sheldon: Don’t you eventually realize you’re just the same
   stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?

   Penny: Yeah, that’s when I buy shoes. Now, let’s see what we’ve
   got. Ooh! This is nice.

   Sheldon: It’s only one colour.

   Penny: Yeah, so?

   Sheldon: That’s a lot of money for only one colour.

   Penny: Fine. Why don’t you pick out what you like.

   Sheldon: Hmm. (Cut to Sheldon exiting changing room in a loud
   check suit). This is pretty sharp.

   Penny: No, you’re wrong.

   Sheldon (now in a sparkly green suit with rhinestones): This is
   great. I had a suit like this when I was six. (Cut to Sheldon
   exiting in a white dinner suit with tails) Okay, I think we
   have a winner.

   Penny: Where the hell d’you find that?

   Sheldon: In the prom department.

   Penny: It’s ridiculous.

   Sheldon: Says the former member of the Corn Queen’s Court.

   Penny: Please just try this one on.

   Sheldon: Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to
   suffer in comparison. (Goes into changing room. Comes out in
   black suit looking terrific.) This is absurd. I look like a
   clown.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: So, Sheldon, how you doing?

   Sheldon: That’s how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I
   doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of
   my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from
   the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph’s.

   Leonard: I’m sorry, I’ll start again.

   Sheldon: Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my
   dreams?

   Leonard: Um, I don’t know, maybe.

   Sheldon: I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But
   everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.

   Leonard: How did you know you were a giant if everything was to
   scale?

   Sheldon: I was wearing size a million pants.

   Leonard: Why don’t we just talk?

   Sheldon: Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice.
   If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the
   standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a
   bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic
   needle.

   Leonard: Why don’t I just start? Sometimes people have trouble
   accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don’t
   feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that’s what’s
   happening here?

   Sheldon: Really, Leonard? You’re just going to try to recycle
   Adler’s doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably
   get that from the woman at Ralph’s. And she’d let me taste some
   pieces of cheese for free.

   Leonard: But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you
   an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science
   fair for my project, “Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical
   Music.” But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of
   my brother’s earlier “Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‘n’
   Roll.” I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.

   Sheldon: And how did that make you feel?

   Leonard: Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I
   stayed up all night singing the clown’s aria from Pagliacci to
   a lima bean sprout.

   Sheldon: Go on.

   Leonard: It wasn’t my fault. I had never seen my brother’s
   project. And my mother could’ve told me before instead of at
   the ceremony in front of everyone.

   Sheldon: So, I hear you saying you’re angry with your mother.

   Leonard: Damn right, I’m angry with my mother. For God’s sake,
   I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That’s when the
   bed-wetting started again.

   Sheldon: Thank you, Leonard.

   Leonard: For what?

   Sheldon: If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl
   out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award
   ceremony.

   Leonard: Wait, that’s it? I thought we had a whole hour!

   Scene: The award ceremony.

   Leonard: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr.
   Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce
   the winner of this year’s Chancellor’s award for Science and my
   good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I’d like to
   share with you a letter from Sheldon’s mother, who couldn’t be
   here tonight. Isn’t that nice? His mother sent him a letter.
   She’s proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly.
   That’s what she calls him. Shelly, it’s a pet name. You know
   what my mother’s pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress.
   Dear Shelly. I am so proud of… (continues as background noise)

   Sheldon: Oh, dear.

   Penny: What’s the matter?

   Sheldon: I’m getting dizzy.

   Raj: Don’t worry. You’re surrounded by your C-Men.

   Sheldon: I can’t do this. I’m going to faint.

   Penny: Here, drink this. It’ll relax you.

   Sheldon: Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol.

   Penny: Fine, faint.

   Sheldon: I don’t feel different, this alcohol’s defective.

   Penny: Here, see if this one works.

   Leonard (still talking): First of all, the projects were
   totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures
   lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn’t hear me.
   If you’d like to look at the relationship between nurturing and
   growth, I’d like to point out that my brother is eight inches
   taller than me.

   Sheldon: I’m ready.

   Leonard: Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour,
   Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

   Sheldon: Thanks, shorty,I’ll take it from here. All right, you
   people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding
   of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic
   topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken
   cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All
   right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a
   drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know
   you’re out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and
   expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic
   dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology
   department, only man who’s happy when they take his work for
   granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it’s
   only ’cause I have no respect for the field. Let’s get serious
   for a moment. Why are we all here? ‘Cause we’re scientists. And
   what do scientists study? The universe. And what’s the universe
   made of? I am so glad you asked. (Singing) There’s antimony,
   arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and
   nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,

   neptunium, germanium… Everybody! And iron, americium,
   ruthenium, uranium, europium, zirconium, lutetium, vanadium…
   Just the Asians! And lanthanum and osmium, and astatine and
   radium…

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some
   questions I’m having about the events of last night?

   Penny: Sure.

   Sheldon: Question one, where are my pants?

   Leonard: You might want to check YouTube.

   Sheldon: What do I search?

   Leonard: It’s already loaded. Just hit play.

   On-screen Sheldon: All right, people, let’s get down to the
   math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our
   imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course
   not. My body’s in the way. But if we had access to higher
   dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through
   the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be
   over.

   Sheldon: Oh, Lord, this couldn’t be any more humiliating.

   Leonard: Uh-uh, give it a minute.

   On-screen Sheldon: Now, for the astronomers in the audience,
   get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here’s Uranus.
