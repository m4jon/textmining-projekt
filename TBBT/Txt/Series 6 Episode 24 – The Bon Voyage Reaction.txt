Series 6 Episode 24 – The Bon Voyage Reaction

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Raj: So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like,
   twenty minutes just staring into Lucy’s eyes.

   Leonard: Oh, that sounds romantic.

   Raj: It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one
   of my top three datesof all time.

   Leonard: So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?

   Raj: I’d love that, but she’s not really comfortable around
   people.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but
   then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved
   character from Star Trek.

   Leonard: How’s that been working for you?

   Sheldon: Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.

   Howard: Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.

   Leonard: I have a job.

   Sheldon: Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.

   Howard: No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking’s team is
   sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic
   simulations of black holes. One of their experimental
   physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.

   Leonard: Well, do you really think I have a shot?

   Howard: Yeah, I’ve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He
   knows your research. I think this could happen.

   Leonard: He knows, wow.

   Sheldon: Well, now, but do you think that’s a good idea? Uh,
   you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt
   really go on an expedition?

   Raj: Hey, don’t discourage him. This is a fantastic
   opportunity.

   Sheldon: No one asked you, Uhura.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Sheldon: Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper
   factoid?

   Leonard: What do you think?

   Sheldon: Great. I’ve been doing some reading about vehicular
   safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning
   accidents happen on or around boats?

   Leonard: Interesting that you would bring that up when I might
   go work on a boat.

   Sheldon: Well, that’s the thing about factoids, they’re
   interesting.

   Leonard: I know what you’re doing. You don’t want me going on
   this research trip because you’re afraid to be alone.

   Sheldon: I’m not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it
   would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.

   Leonard: Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Fine, no more drowning talk. I’ll change the subject.
   Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?

   Leonard: Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for
   me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this,
   there is nothing you can say that’s going to stop me.

   Sheldon: Very well. Things between you and Penny have never
   been better. I hope four months apart doesn’t change anything.
   I should have opened with that, huh?

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment. Lucy is looking through Raj’s
   telescope.

   Raj: If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see
   the International Space Station pass by.

   Lucy: Wow. Your friend was actually up there?

   Raj: Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend
   Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt

   Lucy: Did he take the T-shirt to space?

   Raj: Nope. It’s exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of
   friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking
   maybe we could all hang out sometime?

   Lucy: I don’t know. How many are there?

   Raj: Let’s see. Six. That’s pretty cool, I have six friends.
   Kind of like Sinatra.

   Lucy: Six strangers? That’s a lot of pressure. Staring at me,
   asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are
   you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?

   Raj: Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of
   them?

   Lucy: Will you be there?

   Raj: Of course.

   Lucy: Well, that’s two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is
   getting out of hand.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire
   tray of drinks on myself.

   Leonard: Oh, that’s awful.

   Penny: Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the
   biggest tip of my life.

   Leonard: So, listen, do you remember when I said the
   similarities of the equations of general relativity and
   hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh
   radiation in a large body of water?

   Penny: I thought I said that to you.

   Leonard: Anyway, Stephen Hawking’s team is looking into that,
   and I’ve been invited to join them.

   Penny: Wow, Hawking. Good for you.

   Leonard: Well, it is. Just, you know, I’d be gone for a while.

   Penny: Well, how long?

   Leonard: Three, four months.

   Penny: Whoa. When would you leave?

   Leonard: Couple of weeks.

   Penny: Wow. Oh, okay, well, I’ll just come visit you.

   Leonard: That’s the thing, you can’t. I’ll be on a ship in the
   North Sea.

   Penny: On a ship? Aren’t they afraid Hawking will just roll
   overboard?

   Leonard: Uh, he’s not gonna be there. He’s just sending a team
   to research his theory.

   Penny: Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your
   bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.

   Leonard: Yeah. And I’m a little worried because things between
   us have been so great, and I’d hate to do anything that screws
   that up.

   Penny: Oh, sweetie, if you’re gonna screw things up, it’s gonna
   be while you’re here, not while you’re away. No. I mean, look,
   you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I’m
   just basing that on how much I didn’t understand what you said
   about it.

   Leonard: Okay. I’ll confirm the travel arrangements in the
   morning.

   Penny: Okay. Good.

   Leonard: I do have to ask you one favour.

   Penny: Sure.

   Leonard: Sheldon’s nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye
   on him while I’m gone.

   Penny: Oh, I don’t know. Remember what happened when I took
   care of your goldfish?

   Leonard: Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new
   one.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away
   party.

   Howard: Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to
   somebody when they’re actually going on a voyage?

   Amy: Hello, Rajesh.

   Howard (in Raj accent): Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I
   say? It’s funnier with the accent.

   Leonard: There’s beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really
   don’t need to make a big deal.

   Sheldon: Leonard, you’re being selfish. We need to give you a
   proper send-off so we’ll have closure when you die at sea and
   crabs eat your face.

   Penny: Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.

   Bernadette: You know, one of the things that helped me get
   through Howard being in space for so long was getting married
   before he left.

   Penny: Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.

   Raj: Okay. I have a request to make.

   Amy: And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see
   what the heck’s going on in there.

   Raj: The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil.
   Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all,
   and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just
   one.

   Sheldon: Oh, gee, I don’t know. My schedule’s a little busy.

   Raj: Actually, I was thinking Leonard.

   Leonard: Oh. Thank you, Raj. I’d be honoured.

   Howard: What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.

   Raj: You are, but you’ve got kind of a big personality, with
   your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.

   Penny: You know, maybe she’d be more comfortable meeting a girl
   first.

   Raj: Good idea. Bernadette?

   Penny: What the hell?

   Raj: Well, you’re very pretty. That could be intimidating to
   another woman.

   Penny: Oh, yeah.

   Bernadette: Hey, you don’t think I’m pretty enough to scare
   your girlfriend?

   Howard: Calm down, Bernie. You’re very scary.

   Amy: It should be me.

   Raj: Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?

   Amy: A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B,
   more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know
   how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made
   me feel loved, like I was family.

   Sheldon: Fine, I’ll do it.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Amy: So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and
   then everybody else, and they’ve all been so wonderful to me.

   Lucy: That’s really nice to hear.

   Amy: Maybe next week, we could all get together.

   Raj: Oh, Lucy, you don’t have to answer that. Don’t put her on
   the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you
   hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.

   Amy: Ignore him. He’s a little nervous ’cause he doesn’t think
   I understand the severity of your social anxiety.

   Raj: What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social
   anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them
   socially anxious!

   Amy: Excuse me, but I’m a neurobiologist. I think I’m a little
   more qualified than you to understand what’s not working in
   your girlfriend’s brain!

   Raj: Don’t call her my girlfriend. We haven’t discussed whether
   or not we’re girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it’s out
   there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I’ll
   never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.

   Lucy: I think I have to go to the bathroom.

   Raj: We might as well go ahead and eat. She’s not coming back
   anytime soon.

   Scene: A store.

   Sheldon: This is ridiculous, we’re shopping for a party and
   this store doesn’t even have a party section.

   Penny: Yeah, it does, and here we are.

   Sheldon: You know, I have to say, Penny, I don’t understand why
   you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.

   Penny: Well, I’m his girlfriend, of course I’m gonna support
   him.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, you’re his girlfriend for now. You know,
   maybe you’re not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition
   of men at sea finding comfort in each other’s arms and
   britches.

   Penny: Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to
   work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the
   boat. I checked it out.

   Sheldon: It’s not that big of an opportunity. And even if
   Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the
   universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate
   end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions.

   Penny: Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.

   Sheldon: I’m not jealous. I’m just very unhappy that good
   things are happening for him and not happening for me.

   Penny: Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay?
   But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn’t
   take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a
   little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the
   Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn’t very good at her job.

   Sheldon: It was you.

   Penny: It wasn’t me. But she was also an actress, and we were
   both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got
   it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake
   blonde hair…

   Sheldon: You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.

   Penny: I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I’m happy for
   you. Because that’s what friends do.

   Sheldon: They lie so they don’t look petty.

   Penny: Yeah.

   Sheldon: How?

   Penny: Like this. I am so happy for you.

   Sheldon: Wow. No wonder you didn’t get that toothpaste
   commercial.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj (on skype): Hey.

   Lucy: Hi.

   Raj: I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely
   out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the
   screen freeze again?

   Lucy: Amy wasn’t the problem.

   Raj: Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I’m sorry.

   Lucy: Thank you.

   Raj: You know, I, I’ve been thinking that maybe meeting
   somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends
   are having a party.

   Lucy: A party?

   Raj: A little one. It’s, it’s a farewell for Leonard, so all
   the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and
   sit on the couch, they won’t even know you’re there.

   Lucy: I’m not sure.

   Raj: Oh, please?

   Lucy: Raj.

   Raj: Come on. Don’t make me beg. And I’m from India, so I know
   how to do it.

   Lucy: Okay.

   Raj: Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are
   like my family. Unless you don’t like them, in which case,
   they’re dead to me.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Bernadette: So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat
   before?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Bernadette: Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the
   Small World ride at Disneyland?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Howard: I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea
   for months, that’s really something.

   Leonard: I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure
   of a lifetime.

   Howard: Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.

   Leonard: It’s not a competition.

   Howard: You’re right, you’re right. I’m really proud of you,
   and I’m gonna miss you when you’re gone. And space beats water.

   Amy: Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.

   Raj: She is. She’s just running a little late. You know how it
   is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She’ll
   be here. Just give it a rest, okay?

   Sheldon: Um, can I have your attention, everyone? (Clinks
   glass) That’s, uh, B-flat, for those who don’t have perfect
   pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr.
   Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful
   opportunity, and I couldn’t be happier for him.

   Leonard: Thank you, Sheldon. That must’ve been very hard for
   you to say.

   Sheldon: Well, I mean it. I’m really happy for you. And that’s
   how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.

   Howard: Cheers.

   Penny: Cheers.

   Howard: It was really nice of you to try to be happy for
   Leonard.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Howard: It must’ve killed you when I went to space.

   Raj (Looking at phone): Oh, no.

   Howard: Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.

   Bernadette: What’s going on?

   Raj: Uh, go ahead. Read it.

   Howard: Raj, I can’t come to the party. This is all just too
   much for me. I don’t think we should see each other any more.
   Sorry. Lucy.

   Raj: Excuse me.

   Penny: Raj, I’m so sorry.

   Amy: Me, too.

   Sheldon: It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys
   went to space.

   Scene: Penny’s car, outside the Airport.

   Penny: Well, here we are.

   Leonard: Yep. I’m really gonna miss you.

   Penny: I’m gonna miss you, too.

   Sheldon: Penny, we’re in the red zone. The white zone is for
   loading and unloading. We’re breaking the law.

   Penny: Okay, there’s no space in the white zone, so…

   Leonard: Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone
   connections are pretty good.

   Sheldon: All right, you have to get out of the car right now.
   I’m not going to jail for you.

   Leonard: Would you just relax?

   Sheldon: Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the
   airport.

   Penny: Did you bring enough inhalers?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on
   It’s a Small World.

   Leonard: I’m covered.

   Penny: Okay.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord, a police officer’s glancing in our
   direction. We’ve been made.

   Leonard: Calm down. I’m getting out. I have something I want to
   give you.

   Penny: Oh, Leonard.

   Sheldon: It’s just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of
   Leonard’s face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now
   move, move, move.

   Penny: I love you.

   Leonard: I love you, too.

   Sheldon: Don’t worry, Officer. They just love each other. We’re
   not smuggling drugs.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Penny: Raj, it’s Penny. Are you in there?

   Raj: Hang on.

   Penny: Hey. I’m just coming back from the airport. I wanted to
   see how you’re doing.

   Raj: That’s, that’s very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on
   in.

   Penny: Can’t stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the
   window cracked open. He’s gonna go through that activity book
   in, like, 30 seconds, so… Are you okay?

   Raj: No.

   Penny: Oh. I’m so sorry.

   Raj: No. It’s my fault. You know, I finally found someone who
   was right for me, and I, I drove her away.

   Penny: Oh, Raj.

   Raj: Penny, I, I miss her already.

   Penny: I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.

   Raj: What’s like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can’t I ever
   have love?

   Penny: You will.

   Raj: No, I, I won’t. I’m, I’m unlovable.

   Penny: That’s just the booze talking.

   Raj: No, it’s not. I haven’t had a drink since last night.

   Penny: You’re talking to me.

   Raj: I am. And now I’m crying for a whole different reason!

   Penny: Oh, me, too.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Raj: So I guess what I’m saying is I get where Lucy’s coming
   from.

   Penny: That’s great. Do you want some wine?

   Raj: Uh, no, water’s fine. Anyhow, I’ve been thinking about it
   a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I
   pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her
   enough space, maybe there’s still a future for us. Yeah, the
   funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes…

   Amy: Does he ever shut up?

   Raj: … but then it turns good again, and that means it’s better
   than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now,
   thing’s aren’t good, they are in fact very very bad but at
   least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh
   how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face.
   But I’m a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up
   a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it’s not all
   bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally
   speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining….
