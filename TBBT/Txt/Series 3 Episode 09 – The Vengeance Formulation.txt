Series 3 Episode 09 – The Vengeance Formulation

   Scene: Outside an apartment building.

   Howard: So two years later, there’s a knock on the door, guy
   opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, “What
   the heck was all that about?”

   Bernadette: I don’t really get it.

   Howard: Well, see, it took two years for the snail to… (she
   kisses him) not important.

   Bernadette: Can I ask you a question?

   Howard: Sure.

   Bernadette: Where do you think this is going?

   Howard: To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.

   Bernadette: You’re so funny. You’re like a stand-up comedian.

   Howard: A Jewish stand-up comedian, that’d be new.

   Bernadette: Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.

   Howard: No, I was just… never mind.

   Bernadette: Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both
   know what that means.

   Howard: We do?

   Bernadette: Sex.

   Howard: You’re kidding.

   Bernadette: But I need to know whether you’re looking for a
   relationship or a one-night stand.

   Howard: Okay, just to be clear, there’s only one correct
   answer, right? It’s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?

   Bernadette: Maybe you need to think about it a little.

   Howard: You know, it’s not unheard of for a one-night stand to
   turn into a relationship.

   Bernadette: Call me when you figure it out.

   Howard: Three dates means sex? Who knew?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: Greetings, homies, homette.

   Penny: Why are you back from your date so early?

   Howard: In romance, as in show business, always leave them
   wanting more.

   Penny: What exactly does that mean?

   Leonard: He struck out.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The university cafeteria.

   Howard: Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with
   the same woman is the threshold for sex?

   Raj: Actually, I’ve never had three dates with the same woman.

   Leonard: With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think
   about it, that was three dates.

   Howard: Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask
   for any kind of commitment?

   Leonard: No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her
   options open.

   Sheldon (arriving): I have something to announce, but out of
   respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your
   current conversation. What are you talking about?

   Leonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after
   three dates.

   Sheldon: I see. Now, are we talking date, the social
   interaction, or date, the dried fruit?

   Leonard: Never mind, what’s your announcement?

   Sheldon: Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I
   wanted you to be among the first to know…

   Kripke: Hey, Cooper, I hear you’re going to be on the wadio
   with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.

   Sheldon: Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity
   to share my news with my friends.

   Kripke: My pweasure.

   Sheldon: My thank you was not sincere.

   Kripke: But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what
   point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the
   bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don’t answer, it’s
   wetowical.

   Sheldon: Why are you such a stupid head? That is also
   rhetorical. I’m sorry you had to hear that.

   Leonard: Are you really going to be on NPR?

   Sheldon: Yes, they’re interviewing me by phone from my office,
   regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles
   in spin-ices. It’s pledge week and they’re trying to goose the
   ratings with a little controversy.

   Leonard: Very cool, congratulations.

   Sheldon: Thank you. My mother is very excited. She’s convening
   her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.

   Raj: I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New
   Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays,
   “Fever 104, बहुत अच्छा संगीत के मौजूदा घर.” That means: “Fever
   104, home of the really good current music.” It’s much catchier
   in Hindi.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: All right. These are the talking points for my NPR
   interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they’re simple
   enough for the less educated in the audience to understand.
   Howard, look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.

   Howard: Excuse me, I have a master’s degree in engineering from
   the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the
   completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.

   Sheldon: Yes. Look this over and tell me what’s unclear to you.

   Leonard: You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don’t
   have to do it.

   Raj: In fact, it’s better if you don’t, otherwise it makes the
   rest of us look bad.

   Penny: Hi, guys.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Penny: Yo, Raj, talk to me. I’m sorry, just screwing with you.
   Hey, Howard, why haven’t you called Bernadette?

   Howard: Did she say something?

   Penny: Yeah, she said she hasn’t heard from you in a week. I
   thought you liked her?

   Howard: I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I’m not sure
   she’s my type.

   Penny: She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you
   need?

   Howard: Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought
   when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be
   with someone, you know, different.

   Penny: Different how?

   Howard: Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers,
   or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.

   Penny: Are you high?

   Leonard: You’d have a better shot with the three-breasted
   Martian hooker from Total Recall.

   Howard: Okay, now you’re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that
   movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things
   would be.

   Penny: Howard, you’re going to throw away a great girl like
   Bernadette because you’re holding out for some ridiculous
   fantasy?

   Howard: Hey, just because you settled doesn’t mean I have to.

   Leonard: Excuse me, I’m sitting here.

   Penny: Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he
   isn’t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know,
   physically.

   Leonard: Again, I’m right here.

   Penny: My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am
   interested in the person underneath.

   Leonard: I am here, right? You see me.

   Howard: Hey, I’m interested in what’s inside people, too, but
   why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the
   delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? (To Raj) Yes, you’re
   delicious caramel, too.

   Penny: All right, you know what, I will tell you why it’s
   wrong…

   Sheldon: Excuse me, may I interject?

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified
   in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his
   genetic line.

   Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of
   humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.

   Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has
   tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which
   he is turning on. The radio is playing.

   Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you’re listening to NPR’s Science
   Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena,
   California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

   Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.

   Scene switches to Sheldon’s office, where the end of the tubing
   can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.

   Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.

   Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.

   Ira: Now, let’s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain
   to our audience just what a monopole is?

   Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which
   has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most
   uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises
   further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you
   have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south
   pole.

   Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong
   with our connection.

   Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was
   saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary
   characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole,
   hence, monopole.

   Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up
   the radio for all to listen.

   Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you
   will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an
   expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles.
   Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you!

   Scene: Howard’s bathroom. He is in the bath.

   Howard: So nice you could join me this evening. You’re looking
   lovely as always.

   Katee Sackhoff: Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your
   masturbatory fantasies.

   Howard: Come on, Katee, don’t make it sound so cheap.

   Katee: I’m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a
   real class act.

   Howard: Thank you. So, shall we get started?

   Katee: Sure. But can I ask you a question first?

   Howard: You want to play Cylon and colonist?

   Katee: No. I want to know why you’re playing make-believe with
   me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.

   Howard: You mean, Bernadette?

   Katee: No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette.
   She’s a wonderful girl and she really likes you.

   Howard: I know, but she’s not you.

   Katee: I’m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out
   with a tall, handsome, rich guy.

   Howard: Really? Tall?

   Katee: Six-four.

   Howard: Ouch.

   Katee: The point is, you’ve got a wonderful girl in your life,
   and you’re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the
   bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.

   Howard’s Mother: Howard! What are you doing in there?

   Howard: I’m taking a bath!

   Howard’s Mother: I hope that’s all you’re doing! We share that
   tub!

   Howard: Don’t remind me! (Katee has vanished) Oh, man. All
   soaped up and no place to go.

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Leonard: How ya doin’, buddy?

   Sheldon: I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think
   I’m doing?

   Leonard: Come on, it wasn’t that bad.

   Sheldon: What do you want?

   Raj (in a munchkin voice): We represent the Lollipop Guild, and
   we want you.

   Leonard: Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.

   Sheldon: It wasn’t funny.

   Raj: I thought it was funny.

   Leonard: Raj.

   Raj: You laughed.

   Sheldon: Did you laugh?

   Leonard: I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can
   get him back.

   Sheldon: I refuse to sink to his level.

   Raj: You can’t sink. With all that helium in you, you’re lucky
   you don’t float away.

   Leonard: Are you really admitting defeat?

   Sheldon: I never admit defeat.

   Leonard: Good.

   Sheldon: However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out
   of this bed again.

   Leonard: What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than
   he made you look?

   Raj: I don’t think that’s possible, dude.

   Leonard: You’re not helping.

   Raj: I didn’t come to help, I came to mock.

   Leonard: Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to
   exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got
   back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the
   Criminally Insane.

   Raj: That’s true. He didn’t just stay there and talk about his
   feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out
   and poisoned Gotham’s water supply.

   Sheldon: Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.

   Leonard: No, no.

   Sheldon: It’s a simple matter. There are several toxic
   chemicals that’d be untraceable in an autopsy.

   Leonard: Okay, uh, that’s the spirit, but, um, let’s dial it
   back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.

   Sheldon: Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office
   chair? He’ll sit down, it’ll sound like he’s flatulent, even
   though he’s not.

   Leonard: Let’s keep thinking.

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory. Howard enters.

   Penny: Oh, gee, you’re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder
   Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little
   weasels.

   Howard: Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She’s working
   today, right?

   Penny: Yes, but I don’t think she wants to see you.

   Howard: Why not?

   Penny: Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling
   her all week. Plus, I’ve kind of been talkin’ some smack about
   ya.

   Bernadette: Hello, Howard.

   Howard: Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.

   Bernadette: I can’t now, I’m working.

   Howard: This will only take a second. You asked me to think
   about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette?
   Will you marry me?

   Bernadette: Is this more comedy that I don’t understand?

   Howard: No. I’m serious. I’m never going to find another girl
   like you who likes me and is, you know, real.

   Bernadette: So, this isn’t a joke?

   Howard: No.

   Bernadette: Then you’re insane.

   Howard: I prefer to think of myself as quirky.

   Bernadette: Howard, we’ve only been on three dates. We haven’t
   even had sex yet.

   Howard: Fair enough. When’s your break?

   Bernadette: Wow. (Walks away)

   Howard: Don’t you just hate when this happens?

   Penny: Wow.

   Scene: The apartment kitchen.

   Sheldon: All right, how’s this for revenge? A solution of
   hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.

   Raj: What’s this?

   Sheldon: Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we’re going to
   combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a
   little exothermic release of oxygen.

   Raj: Foamy vengeance.

   Sheldon: Yes, exactly.

   Leonard: This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy
   it in Kripke’s office?

   Sheldon: Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of
   Kripke’s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to
   a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor’s shirt
   pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of
   these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.

   Raj: Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.

   Sheldon: You flatter me, sir.

   Leonard: Let me guess, motion sensors?

   Sheldon: The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the
   center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.

   Leonard: I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the
   Sheldon Cooper way to get even. (Sits down. There is a
   flatulent noise)

   Sheldon: It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee
   cushion has comic validity.

   Raj: Here comes Kripke!

   Leonard: Who is that with him?

   Raj: I believe that’s the president of the university.

   Leonard: And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!

   Sheldon: There is no abort.

   Raj: Well, how could you not put in an abort?

   Sheldon: I made a boo-boo, all right?

   Kripke: I think the board will weally appweciate how well we’re
   using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a
   micwo-contwolled pwasma… (foam falls from the ceiling soaking
   everyone)

   Raj: Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.

   Leonard: At least they don’t know it was you.

   Sheldon (on Kripke’s computer in the lab): Hello, Kripke. This
   classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon
   Cooper. If you’d like to see the look on your stupid face, this
   video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip
   to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support
   and encouragement in this enterprise.

   Raj: Well, I’m going back to India. What’s your plan?

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.

   Penny: Hey, here’s your tip from table seven.

   Bernadette: Oh, thanks.

   Penny: Mm-hmm.

   Howard (on the stage, into a microphone): Testing. Check. Check
   two.

   Bernadette: Oh, now what?

   Penny: You want me to throw him out?

   Bernadette: No, that’s okay.

   Penny: Are you sure? He’s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight
   spiral on him.

   Howard: I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I’ve
   done wrong. (To the tune of the Four Tops song Bernadette)
   Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you,
   Bernadette, you found it creepy but that’s just the kind of
   thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was
   just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette,
   give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I’ll get the hang of
   this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once
   again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard
   Wolowitz, Bernadette…

   Penny: Oh, I am so sorry.

   Bernadette: Are you kidding? That’s the most romantic thing
   anyone’s ever done for me.

   Howard (still singing): …Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake
   Factory!
