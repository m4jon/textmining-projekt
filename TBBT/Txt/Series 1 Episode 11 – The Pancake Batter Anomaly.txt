Series 1 Episode 11 – The Pancake Batter Anomaly

   Scene: The living room of the apartment. Leonard and Sheldon
   are playing the three dimensional chess game from the original
   Star Trek series. It is Leonard’s move. He takes his time,
   moving round the board and checking things from various angles.
   Finally he tentatively makes a move. Sheldon moves almost
   immediately.

   Sheldon: Checkmate.

   Leonard: O-o-o-o-h! Again?

   Sheldon: Obviously you’re not well suited for three-dimensional
   chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your
   speed.

   Leonard: Just reset the board.

   Sheldon: It must be humbling to suck on so many different
   levels.

   Penny (knocking and entering): Hi guys.

   Leonard: Hey!

   Penny: Did you get my mail.

   Leonard: Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?

   Penny: Oh, better than North Dakota! (Pause) I guess that
   joke’s only funny in Nebraska.

   Sheldon: From the data at hand you really can’t draw that
   conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that
   that joke is not funny here.

   Penny: Boy, it’s good to be back.

   Leonard: How was your family?

   Penny: Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the
   weekend.

   Sheldon: Sick?

   Leonard: Here we go.

   Sheldon (running to opposite side of the room): What kind of
   sick?

   Penny: Oh, the flu I guess.

   Sheldon: I don’t need you to guess, I need you to know, now
   when did the symptoms first appear?

   Penny: Maybe Friday.

   Sheldon: Friday, was that morning or afternoon?

   Penny: I… I don’t…

   Sheldon: Think woman, who blew their nose and when?

   Leonard: Sheldon, relax, she doesn’t have any symptoms, I’m
   sure she’s not contagious.

   Sheldon: Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after
   symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago.
   Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus
   would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.

   Leonard: Penny, you’ll have to excuse Sheldon, he’s a bit of a
   germophobe.

   Penny: Oh, it’s okay, I understand.

   Sheldon: Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.

   Leonard: You’d better go before he starts spraying you with
   Lysol.

   Penny: Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.

   Leonard: No problem. Welcome home. (Sees Penny out. Turns to
   find Sheldon spraying the air with Lysol.)

   Sheldon: What?

   Credits sequence

   Scene: The kitchen

   Leonard: What the hell are you doing?

   Sheldon: I’m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.

   Leonard: With lime jello?

   Sheldon: I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the
   apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.

   Leonard: I don’t think so.

   Sheldon: Leonard! If I’m going to get ahead of this thing I
   need to find out what’s growing in my throat.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.

   Sheldon: We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has
   introduced into our environment. And having never been to
   Nebraska I’m fairly certain that I have no cornhusking
   antibodies.

   Leonard: Sheldon, don’t you think you’re overreacting?

   Sheldon: When I’m lying comatose in a hospital relying on
   inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my
   accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.

   Leonard: I’m going back to bed.

   Sheldon: Wait. (Handing him a measuring jug) Put this in the
   bathroom.

   Leonard: What for?

   Sheldon: I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make
   sure my kidneys aren’t shutting down.

   Leonard: I mix pancake batter in this!

   Sheldon: No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.

   Leonard: You had time to make a label for everything in this
   apartment, including the label maker, but you didn’t have ten
   seconds to make one that said urine cup?

   Sheldon: It’s right here on the bottom.

   Leonard: Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter
   of apology.

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. Sheldon wakes up and coughs. Picks up
   an electronic thermometer and takes his temperature.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear God. (Shouting) Leonard! Leonard, I’m sick!

   Cut to Leonard entering living room in panic, stumbling and
   trying to put on a pair of trousers.

   Sheldon (voice off): Leonard! Leonard I’m sick!

   Leonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.

   Sheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet): Leonard! Leonard!
   Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt
   when I bend over. Leonard? (Bends to get phone) Ow!

   Leonard (voice on phone): Hey.

   Sheldon: Leonard, where are you?

   Leonard (running down stairs): I’m at work.

   Sheldon: At six-thirty in the morning?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: On Sunday?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: Why?

   Leonard: They asked me to come in.

   Sheldon: Well, I didn’t hear the phone ring.

   Leonard: They texted me.

   Sheldon: Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been
   tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum
   at an alarming rate.

   Leonard: No kidding?

   Sheldon: No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky
   green.

   Leonard: Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of
   fluids.

   Sheldon: What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised
   plasma?

   Leonard: Drink whatever you want.

   Sheldon: I want soup.

   Leonard: Then make soup.

   Sheldon: We don’t have soup.

   Leonard: I’m at work, Sheldon. (A woman enters the apartment
   building with a barking dog.)

   Sheldon: Is that a dog?

   Leonard: Yes,

   Sheldon: In the lab?

   Leonard: Yes, they’re training dogs to operate the centrifuge
   for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind
   scientists, I have to go.

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom. The phone is ringing.

   Howard’s Mother (voice): Howard, it’s the phone.

   Howard: I know it’s the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.

   Howard’s Mother: Well who’s calling at this ungodly hour?

   Howard: I don’t know.

   Howard’s Mother: Well ask them why they’re calling at this
   ungodly hour.

   Howard: How can I ask them when I’m talking to you! (Into
   phone) Hello.

   Leonard: Howard, it’s Leonard, code Milky Green.

   Howard: Dear Lord, not Milky Green!

   Leonard: Affirmative, with fever.

   Howard’s Mother: Who’s on the phone.

   Howard: It’s Leonard.

   Howard’s Mother: Why is he calling.

   Howard: Sheldon’s sick.

   Howard’s Mother: Were you playing with him?

   Howard: For God’s sake, Ma, I’m twenty six years old.

   Howard’s Mother: Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for
   breakfast.

   Howard: Chocolate milk and eggoes please!

   Leonard: Howard, listen to me.

   Howard: Hang on, call waiting.

   Leonard (voice): No, don’t, don’t….

   Howard: Hello.

   Sheldon: Howard, I’m sick.

   Howard (imitating his mother’s voice): Howard’s sleeping, this
   is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?

   Sheldon: I need soup.

   Howard: Then call your own mother. (To Leonard) It was Sheldon.

   Leonard: I tried to stop you.

   Howard: It’s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in
   place after the great ear infection of ’06.

   Leonard: You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay
   low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.

   Howard: Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?

   Howard’s Mother: I just had the carpets steamed.

   Howard: That’s a negatory. But there’s a Planet of the Apes
   marathon at the New Art today.

   Leonard: Five movies, two hours apiece. It’s a start.

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.

   Waitress: Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.

   Penny: No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?

   Sheldon: I’m sick, thank you very much.

   Penny: How could you have gotten it from me, I’m not sick.

   Sheldon: You’re a carrier. All these people here are doomed.
   You’re doomed!

   Penny: Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.

   Sheldon: I want soup.

   Penny (over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance): Why didn’t you
   just…. (louder throat clearance) Why didn’t you just have soup
   at home.

   Sheldon: Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don’t you imagine that if
   there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have
   thought of it?

   Penny: You can have soup delivered.

   Sheldon: I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is
   setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand
   what a spoon is for.

   Penny: Okay, what kind of soup do you want.

   Sheldon: Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with
   little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.

   Penny: We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.

   Sheldon: Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices
   and home made croutons?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: Then surprise me. (Blows nose into handkerchief. Shows
   it to next table) Would you call that moss green or forest
   green?

   Scene: The cinema. Everyone is wearing ape masks.

   Howard: Look at this, everyone went chimp.

   Raj: Well I’d like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but
   you shouted me down. (Phone rings).

   Leonard: Oh, hi Penny!

   Penny: Hey, where are you?

   Leonard: I’m… uh… at work.

   Penny: You sound funny.

   Leonard: I’m… uh… in a… I’m in a radiation suit. What’s up?

   Penny: Yeah, well I’m at work too, and you’ll never guess who’s
   here infecting my entire station.

   Leonard (To Howard and Raj): Sheldon’s at the Cheesecake
   Factory. (Into phone) Just tell him to go home.

   Penny: He won’t leave, he says he’s afraid he’ll pass out on
   the bus and someone will harvest his organs.

   Leonard (To Howard and Raj): He’s paranoid, and he’s
   established a nest.

   Penny: Can you please come get him?

   Leonard: Uh, yeah, I’d be… I’d be happy to Penny. (Holds phone
   up, Howard makes warning siren noises) Oh my God there’s a
   breech in the radiation unit (Raj joins in) The whole city is
   in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta
   go, bye! (To Howard and Raj) I feel really guilty.

   Raj: You did what you had to do. (Steals some of Howard’s
   popcorn)

   Howard: Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty
   ape.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: Thanks for bringing me home.

   Penny: Oh, it’s okay, I didn’t really need to work today, it’s
   not like I have rent or car payments or anything.

   Sheldon: Good. Good.

   Penny: Okay, well, you feel better.

   Sheldon: Wait, where are you going?

   Penny: Um, home, to write some bad cheques.

   Sheldon: You’re going to leave me?

   Penny: Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven’t you ever been sick
   before?

   Sheldon: Well, of course, but, not by myself.

   Penny: Really, never?

   Sheldon: Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the
   summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.

   Penny: Studying abroad?

   Sheldon: No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was
   a little more sausage-based than I’m used to, and the result
   was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the
   part of Czechoslovakia.

   Penny: And there was no-one there to take care of you?

   Sheldon: No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad
   because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.

   Penny: Again?

   Sheldon: It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house.
   Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn’t speak
   any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick,
   she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”

   Penny: What does that mean?

   Sheldon: Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would
   you like an enema?”

   Penny: Okay, sweetie, I’ll take care of you, what do you need?

   Sheldon: Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.

   Penny: Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no
   enemas.

   Sheldon: Agreed.

   Scene: The cinema.

   Raj: Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.

   Leonard: Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I’m blind here guys, can
   you help me find them?

   Howard: Sorry. (Crunching sound) Found ‘em.

   Leonard: Oh great.

   Howard: Sorry, don’t you have a spare.

   Leonard: Yeah, at home.

   Raj: Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas
   rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.

   Howard: Unless Sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped
   forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.

   Leonard (Dials phone): Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon
   still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay,
   gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta
   go, bye. (To Howard) He’s home, I’m screwed. Ten and a half
   hours of apey blurriness.

   Raj: How about Lasic?

   Leonard: You want me to get eye surgery?

   Raj: Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with
   Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser
   beam?

   Howard: Well?

   Leonard: I’m thinking!

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Penny: Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I’ll see you later.

   Sheldon: Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.

   Penny: Oh, Sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?

   Sheldon: Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.

   Penny: But Sheldon….

   Sheldon: Please, please, please, please, please, please,
   please.

   Penny: I can’t believe I’m doing this.

   Sheldon: No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.

   Penny: Sorry.

   Sheldon: Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.

   Penny: I’m sorry, honey, I don’t know it.

   Sheldon: I’ll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball
   of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you.

   Penny (after a loud sigh): Soft kitty, warm kitty…

   Sheldon: Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.

   Penny (through gritted teeth): Little ball of fur.

   Scene: The living room door, a fibre-optic camera emerges from
   underneath. We see the scene from its point of view. Cut to
   outside. Raj is holding a laptop, Howard is feeding the camera
   under the door.

   Leonard: What do you see, what do you see.

   Raj: The living room appears to be empty.

   Leonard: Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are
   in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.

   Howard: I’m not going in there.

   Leonard: Raj?

   Raj: No way, Jose.

   Leonard: Well I can’t do it, I can’t see anything.

   Howard: It’s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth
   headset. We’ll be your eyes.

   Leonard: Fine.

   Howard: One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If
   Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will
   register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point,
   based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory
   speed of a sick Sheldon, you’ll have seven seconds to get out,
   glasses or no glasses.

   Leonard: Won’t my footsteps set it off?

   Howard: No, you’ll be on your hands and knees. Now you’ll need
   to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon’s room.

   Leonard: Well, how do I carry it if I’m on my hands and knees?

   Cut to Leonard entering apartment on hands and knees, carrying
   the sensor in his teeth.

   Howard: Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.

   Leonard: What?

   Howard: It means go straight.

   Leonard: Then just say go straight.

   Howard: You don’t stay go straight when you’re giving bearings,
   you say keep true.

   Leonard: Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.) I just hit my head.

   Howard: Because you didn’t keep true. (Time shift, Leonard is
   now outside bedrooms) Okay, turn right.

   Raj: The… the picture’s breaking up.

   Howard: Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little
   more. (Leonard now has his head at right angles to his body)
   That’s it, now just keep true. Alright, you’re close enough to
   Sheldon’s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.

   Leonard: It wasn’t on?

   Howard: No.

   Leonard: Then why did I have to crawl?

   Howard: Oh, I guess you didn’t.

   Leonard: Okay, it’s on.

   Howard: Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.

   Leonard: I know.

   Howard: Hang on, the sensor’s picking up something, turn your
   head back. (Camera angle shows a pair of female legs.)

   Penny: You rat bastard.

   Howard (running down stairs with Raj): Told you the sensor
   would work.

   Leonard: Hi!

   Penny: You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

   Leonard: Well, I had to, you see what he’s like.

   Sheldon (off): Penny! Penny, I’m hungry.

   Penny: Uh, it’s okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard’s home!

   Leonard: No!

   Penny (handing him vaporub): Here you go, good luck, bye.

   Leonard: W-wait!

   Sheldon: Leonard, I’m hungry!

   Leonard: Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and
   bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor.  Sheldon
   appears in his comforter.)

   Sheldon: I want grilled cheese.

   Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are on the sofa. Sheldon is
   wrapped in his comforter, Leonard is holding an ice-pack to his
   head.

   Sheldon: Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?

   Leonard: I don’t think Penny’s ever coming here again.

   Sheldon: I’m very congested.

   Leonard: Yeah, so?

   Sheldon: Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey
   baster labelled mucus.

   Leonard: If I stand, I’ll vomit.

   Sheldon: Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl.

   Perhaps if you get some use out of it, you could chuck me a few
