Series 4 Episode 24 – The Roommate Transmogrification

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory

   Penny: Hey, you guys ready to order?

   Howard: Uh..

   Leonard: Sure

   Penny: Okay, Priya?

   Priya: Uh, I’ll have the Shepherd’s Pie. You want to split that
   with me?

   Leonard: Oh, no, no, no, he doesn’t.

   Priya: Why not?

   Leonard: Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy,
   parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn
   into a gas-filled Macy’s Day balloon.

   Sheldon: Not quite accurate. The Macy’s balloons are filled
   with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of
   methane.

   Leonard: So, no, on the Shepherd’s Pie. Can we move on?

   Penny: Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt.
   Do not believe it.

   Leonard: Sea bass. I’ll have the sea bass.

   Howard: You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the
   ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.

   Leonard: Kill me.

   Sheldon: It wouldn’help. The human body is capable of being
   flatulent for hours after death.

   Bernadette: Guys, sorry I’m late. I have amazing news.

   Sheldon: Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone
   have any final comments on Leonard’s faulty digestive system?

   Leonard: So, what’s your news, Bernadette?

   Bernadette: The thesis committee accepted my doctoral
   dissertation. I’m getting my PhD.

   Penny: Oh!

   Sheldon: Oh, congratulations.

   Penny: Wow, so that means you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor,
   you’re a doctor, you’re a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of
   doctors.

   Howard: Congratulations, honey.

   Bernadette: Thank you.

   Leonard: So, Howard, tell us, how’s it feel knowing that when
   you two get married, you’ll be referred to as Mr. and Dr.
   Wolowitz?

   Sheldon: Unless he takes Bernadette’s last name. And
   considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for
   him.

   Howard: Please, this isn’t about me. I’m proud of you.

   Bernadette: Well, you’ll be really be proud of this. I was
   headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They’re gonna pay
   me a buttload of money!

   Howard: What?

   Leonard: Bernadette, that’s great. Howard, do you make a
   buttload?

   Howard: Better than what you’ve got a buttload of.

   Leonard: Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car,
   everything’s peachy. If you do it, you’re still not a doctor.

   Penny: Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps,
   but everything is not peachy.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj (earphones in, singing): Oh, if there was a problem, you
   can’t solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it.
   Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. (Removes headphones and goes to
   refrigerator).

   Priya (off): Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.

   Leonard (off): You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now
   prepare for inspection.

   Priya (off): Shh, my brother’s going to hear you.

   Leonard (off): Relax, he’s got headphones on. And we’re ten
   miles above Earth in a starship.

   Raj: Really, ten miles? You’re orbiting inside the atmosphere?
   Moron.

   Priya (off): I can’t believe I’m wearing my brother’s Halloween
   costume.

   Leonard (off): I can’t believe you think he only wears it on
   Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft
   approaching.

   Raj: Okay, gotta go.

   Scene: Howard’s house.

   Howard: Hey, what’s up?

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Is that my future daughter-in-law, the
   doctor?

   Howard: No, Ma! It’s Raj!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): He’s a doctor too, right?

   Howard: Yes!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!

   Howard: Sheldon, yes! Everybody’s a doctor but me!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Well, whose fault is that?

   Howard: What’s up?

   Raj: Leonard’s putting disgusting memories in my memory foam
   mattress. Can I stay here tonight?

   Howard: Sure, but I’m going out with Bernadette. It’ll just be
   you and my mother.

   Raj: I guess that’s okay.

   Howard: Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Of course, he and I can play doctor!

   Raj: She’s kidding, right?

   Howard: I don’t know, she’s pretty feisty since they put her on
   hormone-replacement therapy.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is talking to Amy on webcam.

   Sheldon: I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that
   Bernadette got her PhD.

   Amy: It’s indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.

   Sheldon: Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the
   distinction.

   Amy: I’ll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ
   responsible for Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies
   yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there
   something wrong with your neck?

   Sheldon: It’s a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile
   structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike
   balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.

   Amy: Have you considered massage?

   Sheldon: I’d like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I
   relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and
   rubbing it.

   Amy: I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own
   hands.

   Sheldon: Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.

   Amy: Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the
   scapula meets the acromion process.

   Sheldon: All right.

   Amy: Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder
   blade, making a small rotation as you do so.

   Sheldon: Rotating.

   Amy: You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and
   forth along the bone.

   Sheldon: You mean the myofascial point?

   Amy: Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade
   noogies we all know too well.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I’ve never been
   touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!

   Amy: Don’t flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided
   by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily
   have paralyzed you.

   Sheldon: There’s someone at my door.

   Amy: That doesn’t interest me. Goodbye.

   Raj (at door): Can I sleep here tonight?

   Sheldon: Why?

   Raj: Leonard’s having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex
   with my sister.

   Sheldon: I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I’ll
   get the sheets and blankets for the couch.

   Raj: Oh, don’t bother. I’ll just sleep in Leonard’s room.

   Sheldon: No, I can’t authorize that.

   Raj: Well, he’s in my bed. Why can’t I be in his?

   Sheldon: The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed
   for a bed.

   Raj: Come on, dude, I’m exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most
   important item in your makeup bag is a good night’s sleep.

   Sheldon: All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your
   use of Leonard’s bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to
   stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.

   Raj: Good night, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety
   procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits
   located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage,
   luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.

   Raj: You’re kidding.

   Sheldon: I never kid about safety.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Leonard enters, and accidentally sits
   on Raj. Both exclaim.

   Leonard: What are you doing here?

   Raj: I was sleeping.

   Leonard: In my bed?

   Raj: Well, I would’ve slept in my own bed, but it was being
   used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene
   Roddenberry.

   Leonard: Oh, you heard?

   Raj: Scotty, I need more power.

   Leonard: Sorry. Does Sheldon know you’re sleeping in here?

   Raj: Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in
   an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR.
   Thank God he had a dummy.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to
   date Howard?

   Raj: Oh, my God, she’s that Mona? Why can’t you and my sister
   spend your nights here?

   Leonard: We tried. She doesn’t get along with Sheldon.

   Raj: Sheldon doesn’t get along with Sheldon. It’s still no
   reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon
   torpedoes every night.

   Leonard: Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own
   place, you stay here and I’ll stay at your apartment.

   Raj: Can I bring girls here?

   Leonard: You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.

   Raj: Okay, deal.

   Leonard: Just not against their will.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: Do you really think you should be eating that cake?

   Howard: Why?

   Leonard: If you’re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife,
   you might want to watch your waistline.

   Raj: He’s right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.

   Howard: Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I’m not threatened by my
   fiancée’s success. I’m proud of her. And secondly, I have my
   own career.

   Leonard: Until you have kids.

   Sheldon: Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the
   lab. You’re okay to stay for a while.

   Raj: When did you take my blood?

   Sheldon: Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I’d
   follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have
   some paperwork here for you to go over.

   Raj: What the hell is this?

   Sheldon: Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a
   temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of
   attorney.

   Raj: This says you can make end of life decisions for me.

   Sheldon: As your friend, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.
   Please sign.

   Raj: Did you sign this?

   Leonard: There’s a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug
   on him, too.

   Raj: Well, that seems fair.

   Sheldon: Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here’s
   your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was
   too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as
   roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the
   comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour
   every other Sunday for fresh air.

   Leonard: Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can
   chase.

   Sheldon: Also, you’re tasked with bringing home all takeout
   dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You’ll find the standard order
   in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have
   any questions, here’s the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human
   touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday
   nights.

   Leonard: No backsies.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Sheldon, dinner!

   Sheldon: What is this?

   Raj: This is the difference between eating and dining.

   Sheldon: Remarkable. I’m just realizing how much Leonard’s been
   skating by all these years.

   Raj: It’s not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha
   Stewart.

   Penny (at door): Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi
   password again?

   Sheldon: Yes, it’s “Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.” No spaces.

   Penny: Thanks. Wow! What’s with the fancy spread?

   Sheldon: My new roommate is bending over backwards to
   ingratiate himself to me. (Pointing to lapel badge) Uh, nice
   touch, by the way.

   Penny: What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to
   Leonard?

   Sheldon: The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was
   replaced by a superior species.

   Raj: I’m the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.

   Penny: All right, let me try this again. Where’s Leonard?

   Raj: He’s living at my place, so I’m living here.

   Sheldon: You’re living here provisionally. But I must say it’s
   looking good.

   Penny: Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That’s big.

   Sheldon: No. Origami napkin swans, that’s the headline.

   Raj: It’s a good thing.

   Scene: Bernadette’s bedroom.

   Howard: So do you know what kind of research you’ll be doing at
   this pharmaceutical company?

   Bernadette: Well, there are a couple of opportunities
   available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation
   project. I mean, it’s not like either one of us has heart
   disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.

   Howard: Oh, Bernie, no. You didn’t have to.

   Bernadette: I wanted to. Come on, open it.

   Howard: You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?

   Bernadette: Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want
   my baby to have pretty things.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: More wine?

   Penny: Oh, no, no, no. I’ve had way too much already.

   Sheldon: Here’s an interesting fact about alcohol.

   Penny: Hit me.

   Sheldon: Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in
   order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is?
   Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.

   Penny: Monkeys.

   Sheldon: When does a monkey have a trunk?

   Penny: When a suitcase just won’t do.

   Sheldon: Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is
   playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please
   note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement,
   kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and
   celebratory gunfire.

   Penny: Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up
   with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside
   your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I’ve got to get me
   some of that?

   Raj: Well, it’s a lot better than having to wear
   noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.

   Penny: What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard’s a noisy little dude
   in the sack.

   Raj: Every night.

   Penny: Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to
   alternate between kissing and breathing?

   Raj: It’s my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?

   Penny: Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?

   Raj: Yeah.

   Penny: I screwed up. Leonard’s a great guy. Never should have
   broken up with him.

   Raj: Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It’s better to have
   loved and lost than to stay home every night and download
   increasingly shameful pornography.

   Penny: Oh, you poor baby.

   Raj: What’s wrong with me, Penny?

   Penny: Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren’t friends, and
   you hadn’t brought up that creepy pornography story, I’d be on
   you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.

   Raj: Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.

   Penny: I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To
   friendship.

   Raj: To friendship.

   Sheldon (off): Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal
   clinking? And the answer was elephant!

   Scene: Raj’s apartment. Leonard and Priya are kissing.

   Leonard: Mmm. Mmm.

   Priya: Leonard, sweetheart, we’re kissing, not eating hot soup.

   Leonard: Sorry.

   Priya (computer tone): That’s my parents on video chat. Go hide
   in the bedroom.

   Leonard: Oh, come on! Why don’t we just tell them that we’re
   dating?

   Priya: Oh, we’ve been through this. It’s not the time.

   Leonard: When is the time?

   Priya: I’ve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound
   to screw up real big, and then I’ll tell my parents about you.
   Now, shoo.

   Leonard: Fine.

   Priya: Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.

   Dr Koothrappali: We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City.
   Is that close to you?

   Priya: No.

   Mrs Koothrappali: Where is your brother?

   Priya: Out with friends.

   Dr Koothrappali: I don’t like it, a young girl alone in an
   apartment.

   Mrs Koothrappali: I’ll sleep so much better when you move back
   here next month.

   Leonard: You’re moving back to India?

   Dr Koothrappali: Who’s that?

   Mrs Koothrappali: Oh, my God! There’s someone in your
   apartment. Call the police in America!

   Leonard: When were you going to tell me about this?

   Priya: Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy,
   Daddy, you remember Rajesh’s friend Leonard.

   Dr Koothrappali: I thought you said Rajesh was out with his
   friends.

   Priya: He has many friends.

   Dr Koothrappali: Rajesh has many friends?

   Mrs Koothrappali: Why are you lying to us?

   Leonard: She’s lying because she doesn’t want you to know we’re
   dating.

   Priya: Leonard!

   Leonard: Well, what difference does it make? If you’re moving
   back to India, we’re obviously breaking up.

   Priya: You know what? I don’t want to deal with this right now.

   Leonard: So. Hot in India?

   Dr Koothrappali: Of course it is. It always is. It’s India.
   Now, what do you have to say for yourself?

   Leonard: Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Raj and Penny are in bed.

   Penny (waking up): Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never
   happened. Do you understand me? (Raj nods) Really? Still can’t
   talk to me?

   Scene: The living room. Leonard is asleep on the couch.

   Sheldon: What are you doing here?

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: I said, what are you doing here?

   Leonard: I live here.

   Sheldon: I have paperwork that says differently.

   Leonard: Priya’s going back to India.

   Sheldon: Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and
   you’re not going to ruin it. (Knock on door) What are you doing
   here?

   Howard: I’ve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.

   Sheldon: Why?

   Howard: She gave me a beautiful watch.

   Sheldon: Leonard, do you understand this?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: Talk to him.

   Penny (entering room dishevelled, with a half naked Raj
   behind): Damn.

   Leonard: What’s going on?

   Penny: Oh. It’s, it’s not what it looks like.

   Sheldon: What does it look like?
