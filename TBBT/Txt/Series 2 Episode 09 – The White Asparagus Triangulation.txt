Series 2 Episode 09 – The White Asparagus Triangulation

   Scene: The lobby.

   Sheldon: Penny, hello.

   Penny: Hey, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: What is shaking?

   Penny: I’m sorry?

   Sheldon: It’s colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you
   find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the
   triumph of some local sports team?

   Penny: What’s wrong with you? you’re freaking me out.

   Sheldon: I’m striking up a casual conversation with you.
   S’u’up?

   Penny: Please don’t do that.

   Sheldon: All right, But I’m given to understand that when you
   have something awkward to discuss with someone, it’s more
   palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.

   Penny: So, this wasn’t the awkward part?

   Sheldon: No.

   Penny: Oh, all right. S’u’up?

   Sheldon: Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you’re aware that
   Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which
   includes a sexual component?

   Penny: Okay, feeling the awkward now.

   Sheldon: Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly
   distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.

   Penny: Yeah, Leonard told me.

   Sheldon: Good. What he may have left out is how important this
   relationship is to me.

   Penny: To you?

   Sheldon: Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard’s been
   involved with, she’s the only one I have ever found tolerable.

   Penny: Well, what about me?

   Sheldon: The statement stands for itself.

   Penny: Well, aren’t you sweet?

   Sheldon: Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it
   would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.

   Penny: Yeah, I think she’s pretty safe.

   Sheldon: You say that now, but consider the following scenario,
   you’re sitting in your apartment, it’s late, you’re alone, your
   hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone
   and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate,
   or a, uh, hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth.

   Penny: Really?

   Sheldon: Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find
   some way to suppress your libido.

   Penny: I could think about you.

   Sheldon: Fine, whatever works.

   Penny: Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Uh, peace out!

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Well, this is very pleasant.

   Leonard: I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself.

   Sheldon: And you said there’d never be enough pasta for the
   three of us.

   Leonard: I stand corrected.

   Sheldon: You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A
   handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient
   for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.

   Steph: That’s very interesting.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Leonard: She doesn’t mean it. She’s just being nice.

   Sheldon: Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping
   the conversational ball, I guess I’ll just have to pick it up.
   Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

   Steph: No.

   Sheldon: Good. What’s your favourite fruit?

   Steph: Ih-uh, strawberries.

   Sheldon: Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did
   you do your medical internship?

   Steph: Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.

   Sheldon: Really? That’s where I was born!

   Steph: You’re kidding!

   Sheldon: I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When
   I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.

   Steph: Why, what-what-what happened?

   Sheldon: Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building
   my own cat scanner.

   Steph: I’m sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?

   Sheldon: No, I didn’t try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly
   able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig, Snowball,
   before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in
   our house, not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner.

   Leonard: Uh, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject
   will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil
   war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from
   the future? (To Leonard) Look at that, there’s even pasta left
   over.

   Leonard: Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?

   Sheldon: I do. Do you? Because frankly, you’ve been in a foul
   mood since I sat down.

   Leonard: Okay, here’s my question, why did you sit down?

   Sheldon: To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and
   history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical
   officer that our landing party has always needed.

   Leonard: What landing party?

   Sheldon: You’re Kirk, I’m Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty,
   Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we’ve
   got McCoy.

   Scene: A cinema.

   Steph: So, we’re all standing around looking at the post-op x
   ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy’s chest
   cavity, one of my earrings.

   Leonard: Oh, my god, what did you do?

   Steph: What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the
   other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of
   there!

   Sheldon (arriving): I have a bone to pick with you, sir.

   Leonard: Oo-oo-oh!

   Steph: Hi, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Hi, Stephanie. I’m sorry I’m late, but your companion
   left the most indecipherable invitation.

   Leonard: What invitation?

   Sheldon: We’re going to the movies. What movie? What theatre?
   What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate
   you, you couldn’t have done a better job.

   Leonard: Oh, clearly I could have.

   Sheldon: It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser
   history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up.
   Wait here, I’ll find us seats.

   Steph: No, no, we have seats.

   Leonard: Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre
   sitting in various seats and shouting “Ha!”)

   Steph: What is he doing?

   Leonard: He’s finding the acoustic sweet spot.

   Steph: Does he always do this?

   Leonard: Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry
   about this.

   Steph: No, it’s fine. you know, he’s sweet.

   Sheldon: My apologies, you’ve been sitting in it all along.
   Leonard, you want to slide over one?

   Leonard: No, just sit here.

   Sheldon: Oh, yeah, this is it.

   Scene: Outside Leonard’s bedroom.

   Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Leonard (knock, knock, knock)
   Leonard (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.

   Leonard: What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?

   Sheldon (showing him laptop): Tell me what you see here.

   Leonard: The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my
   murder trial?

   Sheldon: This is Stephanie’s facebook page. Now, where it
   should say in a relationship, what does it say?

   Leonard: Stephanie Barnett is single.

   Sheldon: Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a
   digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who’s Mike? Why does he
   get a digital sheep and not you?

   Leonard: It’s just her facebook page and we’ve only been going
   out a couple of weeks.

   Sheldon: You don’t see it, do you? We’re losing her.

   Leonard: Okay, I’m going to make this very simple for you. You
   are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in
   anything that happens between me and Stephanie.

   Sheldon: I’m afraid I can’t allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet
   General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby
   relieve you of your command.

   Leonard: General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this
   situation.

   Sheldon: Give me one good reason why not.

   Leonard: Because this is not Star Trek

   Scene: Outside Penny’s door.

   Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock)
   Penny (knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: This is banana bread.

   Penny: This is a door knob.

   Sheldon: It’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food
   can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and
   chat.

   Penny: Sheldon, would you like to come in?

   Sheldon: I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you
   robbed?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: How can you be sure?

   Penny: Sheldon, what do you want?

   Sheldon: I’m certain this will come as no surprise to you, but
   Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.

   Penny: He’s having problems with Stephanie?

   Sheldon: She’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the
   internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need
   data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did
   that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I’m gaining
   remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don’t
   worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to
   include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.

   Penny: We never got to the bedroom.

   Sheldon: Because?

   Penny: Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I’ll tell you what
   happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we
   could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my
   lake house.

   Sheldon: It’s not enough that you made me watch that movie, but
   now you mock me with it?

   Scene: The university cafeteria.

   Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and
   relationships.

   Raj: You told me you were going to have the talk with him.

   Howard: I’ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.

   Sheldon: More to the point, it’s about finding a way to keep
   Leonard and Stephanie together.

   Howard: Oh, I don’t think you can.

   Sheldon: Well, why not?

   Howard: Look at Leonard’s record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.

   Raj: During which she defected to North Korea.

   Howard: Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.

   Raj: For which she awarded him the nickname “speed of light
   Leonard.”

   Howard: And a three hour dinner with Penny.

   Raj: Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the
   souffle when they sat down.

   Howard: Based on the geometric progression, his relationship
   with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.

   Sheldon: Yes, I’m aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12
   to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his
   inevitable rejection?

   Raj: Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie,
   your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.

   Howard: I’ll tell you what you shouldn’t do. Don’t spritz him
   with that body spray from the commercial where the women
   undress when they smell it, that doesn’t work at all, no matter
   how much you put on.

   Sheldon: So, that’s all you’ve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go
   easy on the cologne?

   Howard: Yes.

   Raj: Yeah.

   Scene: Outside Penny’s door.

   Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny (knock, knock, knock)
   Penny.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) : Penny. Zucchini bread.

   Penny: Oh, thank you.

   Sheldon: May I come in?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and
   Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.

   Penny: Well, thank you.

   Sheldon: So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?

   Penny: Yes.

   Sheldon: Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual
   cycle?

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: I’ve been doing some research online, and apparently
   female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they
   find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by
   another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival
   female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation.
   Which brings me back to my question, where are you in (Penny
   slams door). Clearly, I’m 14 days too early.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: All I’m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and
   malaria, why can’t they do something about lactose intolerance?

   Steph: Leonard, you’re going to have to let this go. You had a
   little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.

   Sheldon: Oh, hi Stephanie.

   Steph: Hi.

   Leonard: Want some more wine?

   Steph: Yeah, I assume I’m not driving anywhere tonight.
   (Sheldon lets out a loud noise).

   Leonard: What are you doing?

   Sheldon: I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently
   is destined to go unsatisfied.

   Leonard: Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?

   Sheldon: I’m helping you with Stephanie.

   Leonard: By making constipated moose sounds?

   Sheldon: When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will
   establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female
   witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the
   hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse
   this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which
   lay people naively interpret as falling in love.

   Leonard: Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?

   Sheldon: Yes, actually it would, but let’s see how the lid
   goes. I’m not strong enough, Leonard, you’ll have to do it.

   Leonard: Oh, for god’s sakes.

   Sheldon: Go ahead, it’s pre-loosened.

   Steph: Do you want some help with that?

   Leonard: No, no, no, I got it.

   Sheldon: No, yeah, yeah, he’s got it, and that’s not
   surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in
   my role as the beta male. Open it. (Leonard tries again. Then
   taps jar on counter. Jar breaks.)

   Steph: Oh my god, are you okay?

   Leonard: No, I’m not. I’m bleeding.

   Sheldon: Like a gladiator!

   Steph: Oh, honey, you’re going to need stitches.

   Leonard: Stitches? With a needle?

   Steph: Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.

   Leonard: Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. (Throws up in sink)

   Sheldon: FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.

   Scene: The hospital.

   Sheldon: What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone
   with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you
   can’t argue with her results. It’s a shame it won’t scar, the
   war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.

   Leonard: I can’t remember a time when you weren’t talking.

   Sheldon: Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as
   the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.

   Leonard: I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little
   watery.

   Sheldon: Watery?

   Leonard: She stuck a needle into my hand!

   Steph: Hey, how’s my big cry baby?

   Leonard: I didn’t cry.

   Steph: Okay, I’m just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright,
   it’s all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to
   bed?

   Leonard: Oh, are you still going to spend the night?

   Steph: Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.

   Sheldon: She’s right, as long as you’re vomiting, coitus is
   contra-indicated.

   Leonard: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.

   Steph: Okay, I’m going to go get your discharge papers.

   Leonard (after Sheldon tuts): What?

   Sheldon: Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I
   just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving
   you.

   Scene: The Apartment.

   Leonard: Hey, can you open this for me?

   Raj: Can I see your stitches?

   Leonard: Sure. (Holds out hand. Howard starts to retch).

   Raj: Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz
   bailed out of medical school.

   Penny (entering): Leonard, congratulations.

   Leonard: What for?

   Penny: Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a
   relationship.

   Leonard: What? no. no, that’s not right.

   Howard: Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did?
   Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.

   Penny: Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That’s
   bold.

   Leonard: It’s not bold, it’s a mistake. I didn’t change my
   status.

   Penny: Well, then who did?

   Sheldon: I had no choice, he cried in front of her.

   Leonard: You hacked my facebook account?

   Sheldon: Oh, it’s hardly hacking when you use the same password
   for everything, Kal-el.

   Leonard: Are you insane? Now she’s going to think I’m
   desperate. You’ve destroyed this relationship! And you want to
   know what the worst part is? You don’t even understand what you
   did wrong because you can’t conceive of something that you are
   not an expert in!

   Sheldon: In which I am not an expert.

   Leonard: Don’t even! I don’t want to hear another word out of
   you.

   Penny (after Raj lets out a noise): What’s wrong, Lassie? Timmy
   fall down the well? (He points) Oh, wow. She just updated her
   facebook status.

   Howard: Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard
   Hofstadter.”

   Leonard: Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.

   Sheldon: If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper
   for the win.

   Perhaps if you get some use out of it, you could chuck me a few
