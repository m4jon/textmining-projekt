Series 4 Episode 22 – The Wildebeest Implementation

   Scene: A public washroom. Amy and Penny are in cubicles,
   Bernadette is washing her hands.

   Amy: I must say, Penny, this is great fun.

   Penny: Glad you’re enjoying yourself.

   Amy: Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom
   had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a
   delightful social aspect.

   Bernadette: Amy, you must’ve been in the bathroom with other
   women before.

   Amy: Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed
   off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.

   Bernadette: Some women don’t like to get chummy when their
   panties are down.

   Amy: You okay in there, bestie?

   Penny: I’m fine.

   Amy: The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder
   shyness, the inability to pass urine

   Penny: Yeah, I said I’m fine. Stop talking to me.

   Amy: She always this crabby when she urinates?

   Bernadette: We’re really not that close.

   Penny: Screw it. I’ll go later.

   Amy: And I’ll be right by your side.

   Scene: A shoe shop.

   Bernadette: Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have
   dinner with her and Leonard?

   Penny: Oh, that’s nice.

   Amy: No, it’s not. It’s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard’s new
   girlfriend is testing Bernadette’s loyalty to you and the
   group. That bitch is crafty.

   Bernadette: You think?

   Amy: Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of
   wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.

   Bernadette: Well, what makes me the weakest member?

   Amy: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.
   You wouldn’t last a minute on the Serengeti.

   Penny: Okay, Amy, you’re being silly. I am not concerned about
   who hangs out with who. And I certainly don’t have a problem
   with Leonard’s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.
   Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I’ll have to rent
   my womb out to a gay couple.

   Bernadette: It doesn’t matter. I’m going to tell her we can’t
   make it.

   Amy: Oh, no. You have to go.

   Bernadette: I don’t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny
   wildebeest.

   Amy: You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And
   we’re going to use that to our advantage.

   Penny: Wait. What are you talking about?

   Amy: By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double
   agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya’s
   tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false
   information, such as, Leonard’s no stranger to back-alley
   cockfights.

   Bernadette: I don’t know. I’m not a very good liar. They kind
   of whup that out of you in Catholic school.

   Amy: Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts
   before they found out I was a girl.

   Penny: Okay, I don’t know you people. I’m just an innocent
   woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.

   Amy: How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the
   cleavage of your ample bosom?

   Bernadette: I don’t want anything in my ample bosom.

   Amy: Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.

   Leonard: Okay, see you later.

   Sheldon: Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for
   three-person chess.

   Leonard: That is good news. Bye.

   Sheldon: Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre
   combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to
   triangular tessellation.

   Leonard: That, that’s brilliant.

   Sheldon: It’s what I do. But wait, there’s more. I also
   invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.

   Leonard: Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?

   Sheldon: When the serpent slithers to an opposing player’s
   piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two
   more moves. Ugh.

   Leonard: All right.

   Sheldon: Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which
   case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand
   Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and
   serpent.

   Leonard: Elegant.

   Sheldon: That’s because it’s simple.

   Leonard: Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.

   Sheldon: And…

   Leonard: And what?

   Sheldon: And a third person. It’s three-person chess. I must
   say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your
   mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.

   Leonard: Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.

   Sheldon: Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other
   forces. If he hadn’t been such a hound dog, we’d all have time
   machines.

   Leonard: Got it. Bye.

   Sheldon: You know I’m right.

   Leonard (outside apartment): I think he’s getting worse.

   Amy: Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

   Leonard: You okay?

   Amy: Yeah, yeah. I’m just breaking in some new shoes.

   Leonard: Very pretty.

   Amy: Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make
   the buttocks and breasts more prominent?

   Leonard: Hadn’t really thought about it.

   Amy: Look.

   Leonard: Uh, sure. Very… prominent.

   Amy: Please, Leonard, don’t leer, you have a girlfriend.

   Leonard: Sorry.

   Amy: So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and
   Bernadette?

   Leonard: Yeah. How did you know?

   Amy: I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my
   girlfriends, ’cause, you know, that’s kind of my life now. Have
   a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Priya: Hey, you.

   Leonard: Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?

   Raj: The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I’d rather get a
   prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.

   Priya: Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?

   Raj: I have to feel sorry for myself. I’m the only one who
   cares. Just like I’m the only one who’ll have sex with me.

   Leonard: Really? In front of your sister?

   Priya: We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.

   Raj: Excuse me. I’m going to go wander the streets alone.
   Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city
   with no heart. (Leaves, then returns a moment later) I forgot
   my windbreaker. It’s chilly.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy: I don’t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?

   Penny: No. Once these puppies touch the ground they’re mine,
   and I’ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood
   Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.

   Amy: Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.

   Penny: The what?

   Amy: Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received.
   Commence operation “Priya Wouldn’t Wanna Be-ya.”

   Penny: Hey. Seriously? Didn’t you get enough of this cliquey
   crap in high school?

   Amy: I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn’t have any.

   Penny: None?

   Amy: I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and
   eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a
   puta and made me stop. Hang on. It’s the wildebeest. Priya just
   made a snide comment about your acting career.

   Penny: Wh… What the hell did she say?

   Amy: She thinks it’s cool you’re following your dream, no
   matter what.

   Penny: That bitch!

   Amy: How do you want to handle it?

   Penny: Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I’m on my
   way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.

   Amy: Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?

   Penny: What? I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.

   Amy: I’m gonna say 3-D. That’ll let her know the studio has
   faith in it.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Leonard: You’re kidding. 3-D?

   Bernadette: That’s what I hear.

   Howard: Then the studio must have real faith in it.

   Leonard: Wonder why she didn’t tell me.

   Priya: Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?

   Leonard: No.

   Priya: Then why are you surprised she didn’t tell you?

   Leonard: Well, it’s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know,
   uh. th-th-th-the other thing.

   Priya: What other thing?

   Leonard: Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don’t,
   oh, what’s the word I’m looking for?

   Howard: I’m not going to help you. This is hilarious.

   Bernadette: She’s also dating an astronaut.

   Priya: Wow. That’s very impressive.

   Bernadette: Yeah. But Leonard’s impressive, too.

   Leonard: Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was
   befuddled.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing three person chess by
   himself.

   Sheldon: Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move.
   Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?

   Raj: I need a hug.

   Sheldon: Sorry, I have company.

   Raj: Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

   Sheldon: I don’t want to hug you.

   Raj: I don’t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.

   Sheldon: Blue, as in depressed.

   Raj: Well, not so much depressed as lonely.

   Sheldon: I don’t know what colour lonely is.

   Raj: What?

   Sheldon: Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous
   and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to
   lonely.

   Raj: Nothing rhymes with orange. It’s probably lonely.

   Sheldon: All right. Come in. You look positively orange with
   loneliness. No, I don’t see that catching on at all.

   Raj: What are you doing?

   Sheldon: I’m working on my three-person chess game.

   Raj: Oh, cool. Can I play?

   Sheldon: It’s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?

   Raj: No.

   Sheldon: Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out
   why the two of us can’t play three-person chess. Can you
   believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to
   bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.

   Raj: No, thank you. I’m fine.

   Sheldon: It’s not optional. We’re out of tea. I hope you like
   bouillon.

   Raj: I, uh, I guess you’re probably wondering what’s got me
   down.

   Sheldon: Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new
   chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince
   Joey, the king’s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?

   Raj: I’m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life
   to love me. I’m such a basket case, I can’t even talk to a
   woman without having alcohol in my body.

   Sheldon: The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he
   moves, there’s a one-in-five chance he’ll kill himself.

   Raj: Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and
   I’m scared.

   Sheldon: Yellow. Go ahead.

   Raj: A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new
   pills they’re testing. He says it’s the next big thing for
   social anxiety disorder.

   Sheldon: Fascinating. What’s in it?

   Raj: I’m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a
   molecule extracted from the urine of cows.

   Sheldon: I like cows.

   Raj: That’s not the point.

   Sheldon: It was its own point. Go on.

   Raj: I’m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and
   butter. I’m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special,
   unique something that makes me so successful in my field.

   Sheldon: Rajesh, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside
   you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these
   up like Tic Tacs.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Howard: Okay, I’m still trying to work this out. How did Penny
   meet an astronaut?

   Bernadette: I don’t know. The regular way people meet
   astronauts.

   Howard: Most of those guys live in Texas.

   Bernadette: Obviously, this one doesn’t.

   Howard: Okay.

   Bernadette: Leonard lives here. Priya’s from India. People
   meet, Howard. God!

   Howard: Fine.

   Bernadette: You’ve met lots of astronauts, and I’ve never
   grilled you about that. I’d thank you to extend me the same
   courtesy.

   Howard: I’m not grilling you, I was just curious.

   Leonard: I still can’t get over the fact that she got a big
   movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend’s up to,
   ’cause I don’t.

   Bernadette: Maybe that’s where she met the astronaut, all
   right?

   Priya: I’m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a
   movie?

   Bernadette: He’s a consultant.

   Leonard: I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?

   Bernadette: He can’t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or
   is that implausible, as well?

   Howard: It’s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn’t
   it?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny (to the shoes): All right, guys, you have to go back. I
   can’t afford you. “No, don’t send

   us away, we love you.” I love you, too, but you cost more than
   my rent. “But, Penny, you look so good in us.” Damn it, the
   shoes are right.

   Amy: Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. (Phone rings)
   What do you got for me, wildebeest?

   Bernadette (in Raj’s bathroom): I think they’re on to me. The
   story’s starting to fall apart.

   Amy: Calm down. Everything’s going to be okay. (To Penny) We
   may have to kill her. Bernadette, I’m putting you on
   speakerphone. Where are you now?

   Bernadette: In the bathroom.

   Amy: Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom
   gabfests. What’s the problem?

   Bernadette: They’re just asking me all sorts of questions I
   can’t answer.

   Amy: Just change the subject.

   Bernadette: I suppose I could get them back to talking about
   Leonard going to India to meet Priya’s parents.

   Penny: What?

   Bernadette: They said something about going there this summer.

   Penny: What, are they getting engaged?

   Bernadette: I don’t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on
   Amy’s stupid astronaut story!

   Amy: What astronaut story?

   Bernadette: You texted me Penny’s dating an astronaut.

   Amy: I texted architect. That’s amusing. Auto-correct must’ve
   changed it.

   Bernadette: Yeah, it’s hysterical.

   Penny: All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.

   Amy: Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?

   Penny: Look, just find out what’s up with this trip to India.

   Bernadette: I don’t want to do this anymore!

   Penny: Don’t you quit on us!

   Howard (knocking on bathroom door): Bernie, you okay?

   Bernadette (screaming): It was an architect!

   Scene: A coffee shop.

   Raj: Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You’re a good
   friend.

   Sheldon: I’m glad you think so. That’s what I strive to
   emulate.

   Raj: Okay, let’s see if this drug works.

   Woman at table: Can I help you?

   Raj: Forgive me for staring, but you’re very beautiful.

   Woman: Thank you. That’s a great accent. Where are you from?

   Raj: India.

   Woman: Oh, cool. I’ve always wanted to go there.

   Raj: It’s a beautiful country. You’d love it. May I join you?

   Woman: Uh, okay, sure. Why not?

   Raj: My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend
   Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

   Woman: Hi.

   Sheldon: Oh, there’s no need to interact with me. I’m just here
   to observe.

   Woman: What’s he observing?

   Raj: We’re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy
   yourself a scone.

   Sheldon: All right.

   Raj: And what is your name?

   Woman: Angela.

   Raj: Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.

   Angela: You’re cute.

   Sheldon: I’d like to buy a scone.

   Server: Oh, I’m sorry, we’re out. We have muffins.

   Sheldon: They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for
   scones.

   Angela: What are you doing?

   Raj (taking his shirt off): Oh, just getting comfortable. So
   how long have you lived in Los Angeles?

   Angela: I…

   Sheldon: They were out of scones.

   Raj (removing his trousers): Sheldon, I’m talking to someone.
   You’re being rude. I’ll bet you’re an actress. If not, you
   should be. You have a very expressive face.

   Angela: Oh, my God.

   Raj: Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She
   never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!

   Scene: Raj’s apartment. They are playing Jenga,

   Priya: Who wants some more coffee?

   Leonard: Thanks, yeah.

   Howard: Sure.

   Bernadette: Let me help you.

   Howard: Nice to see that the gals are getting along.

   Leonard: Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

   Bernadette: This trip to India sounds fun.

   Priya: Yeah, I think it will be.

   Bernadette: Are you concerned your parents might not approve of
   Leonard?

   Priya: A little. They’re very old-fashioned.

   Bernadette: Well, I wouldn’t worry about it. It’s not like you
   guys are getting engaged, right?

   Priya: Oh, God, no. We’re not there yet.

   Bernadette: Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.

   Priya: You’ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?

   Bernadette: Yes. Are you writing a book?

   Priya: Why are you getting upset?

   Bernadette: I’m not upset. Maybe you’re upset.

   Priya: What’s up with you? Bernadette?

   Bernadette: I can’t do this anymore! I’m a good girl! I went to
   Catholic school! (Storms out,)

   Howard: Okay, well, it’s getting late. This was terrific. You
   win. Bernie?

   Leonard: I think the word you’re looking for is befuddled.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are playing
   three person chess.

   Sheldon: My catapult flings my bishop to Howard’s Queen’s
   Gorilla two.

   Howard: Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out
   at Leonard’s Queen’s Bishop

   five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.

   Leonard: Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?

   Sheldon: When it’s done charging. Or you land on the time
   machine. Obviously.

   Leonard: Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and
   release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.

   Sheldon: I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.

   Raj (still naked): Hey, I’ve got winners.
