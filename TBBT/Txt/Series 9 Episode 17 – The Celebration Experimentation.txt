Series 9 Episode 17 – The Celebration Experimentation

   Scene: The stairwell

   Amy: So Sheldon, there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk
   about but I know it’s kind of a touchy subject.

   Leonard: Way to narrow it down to everything.

   Sheldon: What is it?

   Amy: Well, your birthday’s coming up, and you’ve never let us
   celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.

   Sheldon: Oh, I suppose that’s a discussion we could have.

   Amy: Okay, great, I mean, it doesn’t have to be a big party or
   anything. I was just, where’d he go?

   Penny: W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he
   vanishes?

   Leonard: Well, where’s that information been this whole time?

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Well, where is he?

   Amy: Sheldon?

   Leonard: I’ll check his room.

   Sheldon: Surprise.

   Penny: Oh, my God.

   Sheldon: Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible.
   Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I
   suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You
   know, the answer, it may surprise you.

   Amy: I’m sorry I brought it up.

   Penny: Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?

   Sheldon: Please, look at this porcelain skin. I’m like a human
   sink.

   Amy: But it’s the one day a year that’s just all about you.

   Leonard: One day. Right.

   Amy: Can you please just tell me why?

   Sheldon: Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I
   obviously share a birthday. Every year we’d have a party. No
   one I invited would ever come, because they didn’t like me.

   Amy: I’m sorry.

   Sheldon: Oh, that part wasn’t so bad. I didn’t like them,
   either. But then I’d inevitably spend the whole day being
   tortured by my sister’s friends.

   Penny: Oh, poor thing.

   Sheldon: When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my
   party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman
   I saw was when a robin flew into the window.

   Amy: You realize none of those things would happen now?

   Sheldon: I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday
   at all?

   Amy: Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to
   return the favour.

   Penny: You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of
   friends that would love to come.

   Leonard: And we live here, so we have no choice.

   Penny: Yeah.

   Sheldon: Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a
   party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love.
   But then you owe me big-time.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Howard: You have any idea what you’re getting Sheldon for his
   birthday?

   Raj: He’s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could
   get him a fossil.

   Leonard: Well, just don’t get anything Jurassic. He feels like
   that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know,
   he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into
   thinking Batman was coming to his party.

   Howard: That’s funny. Let’s do that.

   Leonard: Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.

   Raj: You mean, some guy in a lame suit?

   Leonard: Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn’t you try to get
   Adam West to do a signing here once?

   Stuart: Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He,
   uh, wanted to know when he’d get paid. And I wouldn’t tell him.

   Leonard: Can I get his contact info?

   Stuart: Sure, uh, but just so you know, he’s kind of a diva.

   Leonard: He is?

   Stuart: Oh, yeah. Won’t take the bus. He won’t pack his own
   lunch. Won’t let you spend the night on his couch.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?

   Sheldon: Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water
   balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.

   Penny: All right, what about music?

   Sheldon: I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.

   Penny: No music it is.

   Bernadette: What kind of cake do you like?

   Sheldon: Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry
   frosting, three layers, and if there’s writing on it, make sure
   it’s not all caps. I don’t need my dessert yelling at me.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Raj: Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?

   Leonard: Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman
   say don’t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.

   Raj: You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after
   Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.

   Howard: Don’t say that to him.

   Raj: What? He beat out George Clooney, and that’s something.
   Like, I love me some Clooney.

   Leonard: Don’t say that to anyone.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.

   Stuart: Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I
   don’t always feel like I’m part of the group.

   Penny: Okay, sweetie, we’re on the clock here. Can you hate
   yourself and frost at the same time?

   Barry: Hewwo, I hope I’m not too earwy.

   Bernadette: No, no, no. Come on in.

   Barry: And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?

   Bernadette: Doing great.

   Stuart: You, you’re pregnant?

   Bernadette: Yeah.

   Stuart: Sounds like something a member of the group might know.

   Penny: Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Leonard: Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front
   of Christian Bale?

   Adam West: Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale’s overrated.

   Raj: Thank you. That’s why I say Keaton’s number one. He
   brought a sense of humour to the role.

   Adam: Oh, if you’re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I
   should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton,
   Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.

   Howard: Really? You’re ahead of Bale? The man who personified
   the words, I’m Batman.

   Adam: I never had to say I’m Batman. I showed up, people knew I
   was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings,
   Julie Newmar’s bungalow.

   Leonard: I’m sold, you’re ahead of Bale.

   Adam: There’s another reason I should be higher on the list.
   All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All
   I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.

   Howard: Can we just all agree we’re worried about Affleck?

   Leonard: Sure.

   Raj: Yeah, of course.

   Adam: What’s an Affleck?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?

   Amy: Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first
   time all decorated.

   Sheldon: But who’s gonna tell them they’re doing it wrong?

   Amy: Well, I’m, I’m sure they’ll ask you to give a speech, and
   that’s when you just tear ’em a new one. Have to say, you, you
   do look good in that suit.

   Sheldon: Oh. Thank you.

   Amy: Maybe later I’ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday
   suit.

   Sheldon: But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke?
   Because that’s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday
   party.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: So, Mother, I’m surprised you came all this way for
   Sheldon’s birthday.

   Beverley: Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.

   Leonard: Oh. You had a party for your 60th?

   Beverley: Oh, I wouldn’t call it a party. Just a few close
   friends. And your sister and brother.

   Penny: You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and
   didn’t invite her.

   Beverley: And I never did thank you for that, dear.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy: Oh. Penny says everyone’s there. Are you ready?

   Sheldon: I am. Oh. Wait.

   Amy: Are you all right?

   Sheldon: No, I just, I got a little light-headed.

   Amy: Oh, do you need a minute?

   Sheldon: No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the
   parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.

   All: Happy birthday!

   Leonard: Speech! Speech!

   Raj: Come on, Sheldon, say something.

   Sheldon: Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly.
   Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.

   Leonard: Batman finally came to your party.

   Adam: Happy birthday, Sherman.

   Sheldon: Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.

   Adam: I still get paid, don’t I?

   Scene: A little later.

   Leonard: Okay, I’d better go in there and talk to him.

   Amy: Well, don’t you think I’m the one who should go in?

   Leonard: No offence, but I’ve known the guy a really long time.

   Amy: Well, I’ve, you know, seen him without pants on.

   Leonard: Again, no offence, but so have I.

   Amy: Well, he’s seen me without pants on.

   Leonard: Again, no…

   Penny: Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come
   in?

   Sheldon: How do you know I’m not using the facilities?

   Penny: Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a
   week, even though I’ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand
   times. So, what’s going on?

   Sheldon: I don’t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all
   the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.

   Penny: I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in
   here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the
   toilet. It’ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

   Sheldon: I know that you worked hard to put this together. I’m
   sorry I’m ruining it.

   Penny: Oh, pl, you’re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj
   will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that
   will ruin it.

   Sheldon: I don’t think I can go back out there.

   Penny: That’s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her
   friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I
   was there, I would have tortured you, too.

   Sheldon: Based on this pep talk, I’d say you’re still doing it.

   Penny: My point is, there was a time I never would’ve been
   friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my
   favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your
   birthday in a bathroom, I’m happy to do it with you.

   Sheldon: Well, everyone will think I’m weird.

   Penny: Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you’re weird, but
   they’re all still here because they care about you so much.

   Barry (knocking): Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair
   because we might have a shot with Weonard’s mother.

   Scene: Later.

   Leslie Winkle: Leonard.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Leslie: It’s been a while.

   Leonard: Leslie. I can’t remember the last time we talked. So
   much has changed.

   Leslie: Has it?

   Leonard: Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.

   Leslie: Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought
   you’d be living with Sheldon forever.

   Leonard: Yeah, well, don’t be a stranger.

   Penny: Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I
   think he’s a little embarrassed, so let’s all be extra nice,
   okay?

   Barry: What are you wooking at me for? I’m a saint. But a
   sinner in the sack.

   Sheldon: Hello, everyone. I, I’d like to apologize for my
   behaviour. I hope it hasn’t put a damper on the party. So,
   please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of
   hand.

   Amy: If I may, I, I’d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you
   all for coming tonight. I know it’s customary for the birthday
   boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest
   gift the day he was born.

   General cheers.

   Sheldon: Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let’s
   do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.

   Howard: Sheldon, I don’t think everyone…

   Sheldon: Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.

   Howard: Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we’ve known each other a long
   time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my
   friend.

   Sheldon: Little generic. Keep thinking. We’ll circle back. Wil
   Wheaton, go.

   Wil: Sheldon, I know that we’ve had our ups and downs, but I
   can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting
   because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of
   Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long
   and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.

   General cheers.

   Sheldon: That’s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he’s
   famous and you’re not.

   Beverley: Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for
   you, and we all can’t wait to see what they are. Happy
   birthday, dear.

   General cheers.

   Barry: Someone caw Animal Contwol. There’s a cougar on the
   woose.

   Beverley: Barry, stop.

   Leonard: Seriously, Barry, stop.

   Raj: And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die
   tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.

   Sheldon: And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let’s speed this
   up. A lot of people want to talk.

   Leslie: Uh, in the past, I would’ve said something obnoxious,
   like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I’m not gonna do it. You and
   I have both grown a lot, and it’s just so nice to see you all
   again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.

   Leslie: Happy birthday, dumbass.

   General cheers.

   Adam: Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed
   seeing me here today, I’m also available for Comic-Cons,
   bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs…

   Bernadette: I can’t think of anything to say that hasn’t
   already been said, so, here’s to you, Sheldon.

   General cheers.

   Sheldon: Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.

   Howard: What? You gotta be kidding me?

   Leonard: Sheldon, we’ve been together so long, it’s hard to
   remember a time you weren’t in my life. And believe me, I try.
   You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me
   crazy. You’re more than just my roommate, you’re my brother.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Leonard: Happy birthday, buddy.

   General cheers.

   Sheldon: Thank you. That, that was wonderful.

   Penny: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn’t get to speak.

   Stuart: Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I’ve spent most of my
   life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone…

   Amy: Hey, everybody, listen up.

   Penny: You nailed it.

   Amy: We’ve got someone who couldn’t be here but really wanted
   to wish you a happy birthday.

   Stephen Hawking (on Skype): Hello, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Professor Hawking.

   Stephen: Happy birthday to you.

   Sheldon: Thank you so much. I can’t believe you’re…

   Stephen: Happy birthday to you.

   Sheldon: Oh, you’re singing. Well, I’m sorry.

   Stephen: Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.

   Leonard: Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second,
   we’ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.

   Stephen: I was crushing it, but all right.

   Penny: Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to
   say, I hope you didn’t think you were gonna get through tonight
   without a hug.

   Sheldon: You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they’re just
   extremely irritating.

   Leonard: Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.

   Stephen: And a one, and a two…

   All: Happy birthday to you,

   Happy birthday to you,

   Happy birthday, dear Sheldon,

   Happy birthday to you.

   General cheers.

   Adam: So, who’s taking me home?
