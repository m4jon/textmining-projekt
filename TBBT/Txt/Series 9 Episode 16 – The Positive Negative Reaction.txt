Series 9 Episode 16 – The Positive Negative Reaction

   Following a “previously on” sequence.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.

   Howard: Morning.

   Bernadette: Morning.

   Howard: We? What is this?

   Bernadette: I don’t know. Maybe it says something on the back.

   Howard: Continued on milk. If you’re tricking me into making my
   own breakfast, it didn’t work for my mom, and it won’t work for
   you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.

   Bernadette: What could it be? We are Groot? We are the
   champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?

   Howard: Are you serious?

   Bernadette: Yeah.

   Howard: Are you sure?

   Bernadette: Pretty positive. That’s a joke, because the
   pregnancy test says…

   Howard: Oh, my God. This is incredible. We’re gonna be parents?
   We’re gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see
   what’s in that family bathroom at the mall.

   Bernadette: I know, it’s crazy.

   Howard: It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for
   something like this? I’m not even sure I’ve held a baby before.

   Bernadette: Oh, it’s okay, you’ll figure it out.

   Howard: But how’s this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I
   mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can’t get a
   pretty one, ’cause it’ll wreck our marriage. We can’t get an
   ugly one, ’cause it’ll scare the kid.

   Bernadette: I don’t know, Howie.

   Howard: Are we in a good school district? You’re Catholic, I’m
   Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it’s a boy, do we
   get him circumcised? People say it’s barbaric, but if we don’t,
   it looks like a pig in a blanket.

   Bernadette: Calm down, it’s gonna be okay.

   Howard: How’s it gonna be okay? Look at me, I’m a mess. And
   that means this baby’s gonna be half a mess. And that’s even
   before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive
   nanny.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department
   may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?

   Sheldon: Oh, I heard about that. Why didn’t you discover it?

   Raj: Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy
   making you guys home made jam for the holidays.

   Sheldon: Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the
   Nobel Prize for boysenberry.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Raj: Hey, bud.

   Leonard: Ready to play when you are.

   Howard: Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys
   something.

   Raj: If it’s thank you for the home made jam you got in
   December, congratulations, you’re the first one.

   Leonard: What’s going on?

   Howard: I’m, uh, uh, gonna be a father.

   Leonard: What? Congratulations.

   Raj: That’s so amazing.

   Sheldon: Oh, no.

   Leonard: Why oh, no?

   Sheldon: Because this changes everything. What about comic book
   night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our
   trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child
   around?

   Leonard: Relax, there’s room for two babies in this group.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear lord, Penny’s pregnant, too?

   Leonard: You’re the other baby.

   Sheldon: Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave
   once every 11 days?

   Leonard: Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers
   because one of them was broken?

   Sheldon: I guess we’ll call this a draw.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s patio.

   Bernadette: So, I’m glad you guys are here. There’s something I
   want to share with you. Howie and I are going to…

   Penny (reading text): Leonard says you’re pregnant.

   Amy: What?

   Penny: Don’t say anything. act surprised when she tells you.
   All right, how you want to do this?

   Bernadette: I’m pregnant.

   Penny: Oh, my God, I can’t believe it.

   Amy: This is so exciting.

   Bernadette: Yeah, it’s all real exciting.

   Penny: Are, are you not happy about this?

   Bernadette: I am. Of-of course I am. I’m, I’m sure it’s just
   the hormones. But it’s weird, Howie’s the one who’s been
   talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to
   tell him because I thought he’d be thrilled, but then he
   started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I’m
   gonna get fat.

   Penny: No, no, come on. Come on, you’re not gonna get fat.
   You’re gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest
   little baby bump ever.

   Bernadette: Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.

   Penny: Oh, that’s all right. All I heard was skinny.

   Amy: I wouldn’t make too much out of Howard not reacting the
   way you expected him to.

   Penny: Yeah, I’m sure it was just the initial shock of it all.

   Bernadette: You’re probably right. After we talked about it, he
   started to calm down.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: I shouldn’t be raising a kid. I don’t even eat my own
   vegetables.

   Leonard: Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.

   Howard: And then there’s this nose. I mean, what if he looks
   like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?

   Sheldon: Not to mention the impact on our social circle.
   Everything’s going to change. Howard won’t be able to come over
   as much.

   Raj: Well, he could bring the baby here.

   Sheldon: Oh, but then we’d have to baby-proof the apartment.
   You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her
   bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.

   Howard: Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive
   having a kid is?

   Raj: I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through
   college can cost over a million dollars.

   Howard: A million dollars? God, it’s like my nuts just kicked
   me in the nuts. That’s it, I got to start earning more money
   right now.

   Raj: I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your
   allowance.

   Howard: This isn’t a joke.

   Raj: I wasn’t joking.

   Leonard: It’ll be fine. People have kids every day. You’ll
   figure this out.

   Raj: Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.

   Howard: You’re right, it is, I’m just a little overwhelmed
   right now.

   Leonard: Hey, you know what we should do?

   Sheldon: All get vasectomies so this doesn’t happen to us?

   Leonard: Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s patio.

   Amy: Hey, let’s go do something to get your mind off this.

   Penny: Yeah, yeah, we should go out.

   Bernadette: Where?

   Penny: Uh, I don’t know, a bar?

   Bernadette: Can’t drink.

   Penny: We can, but all right.

   Amy: Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?

   Bernadette: Doctor said I can’t have sushi.

   Penny: Okay, look, we don’t have to go anywhere. We can just,
   you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.

   Bernadette: Doctor said I can’t go in the hot tub.

   Amy: Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can’t
   laugh either?

   Scene: A bar.

   Raj: I’d like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his,
   um, his big heart, his beautiful soul…

   Leonard: And his tight little pants that somehow did not make
   him sterile.

   All: Cheers.

   Howard: Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny
   umbrellas doesn’t have to worry about money. He can have all
   the kids he wants.

   Sheldon: And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.

   Howard: If I’m gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I
   need to come up with a big idea to make some money.

   Leonard: There’s no reason you can’t.

   Howard: That’s easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already
   came up with your superfluid helium model.

   Leonard: That’s just research. We’re never gonna make any money
   from it.

   Sheldon: Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch
   in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy’s secret don’t tell mama
   juice.

   Leonard: Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.

   Sheldon: Oh. I’ll just take one last sip. Ah.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Howard: Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger
   cocktail umbrellas.

   Leonard: How is that a new invention?

   Howard: I don’t know, all Apple does is change the size of
   things and we keep buying them.

   Raj: It’s true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost
   as much as my regular-sized iPad.

   Sheldon: This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been
   here before?

   Leonard: The same reason we don’t do a lot of fun stuff. You.

   Sheldon: That’s some smart talk from a guy who can’t even keep
   his face in focus. Where’s the bathroom?

   Raj: Uh, it’s in the corner.

   Sheldon: Excuse me. Hey, how you doin’?

   Raj: I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.

   Leonard: Doesn’t matter. He’s headed for the kitchen anyway.

   Howard: Maybe that’s an idea, guidance systems for drunk
   people.

   Raj: They have that. It’s called Uber.

   Howard: Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you
   create quantum vortices?

   Leonard: Yeah. Why?

   Howard: Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn’t you use
   those vortices as a gyroscope?

   Leonard: Wow. I’ve never thought about that.

   Howard: And since it’s in a quantum state, it would maintain an
   infinite persistence.

   Raj: Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this
   isn’t like the best episode of Sex and the City.

   Leonard: You may have actually just come up with something.

   Howard: You think so?

   Leonard: I really do.

   Sheldon: You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There’s people
   cooking in it.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s patio.

   Amy: Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have
   a baby.

   Penny: Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.

   Bernadette: I kind of already do that for Howie.

   Penny: And whenever you’re hungry, you’ll be in a minivan with
   Cheerios all over the floor.

   Amy: Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only
   lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get
   pregnant?

   Bernadette: Well, we didn’t exactly decide. We were talking
   about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.

   Penny: Oh, tell us.

   Amy: Yeah, tell us.

   Bernadette: No, I’m embarrassed.

   Penny: Oh, come on, we’re all grown-ups. We’ve all done it.

   Amy: Me, me, me too. I’m a grown-up and I’ve done it.

   Bernadette: Fine. We were out one night, and things got a
   little spontaneous.

   Amy: Oh, that sounds juicy.

   Bernadette: Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones
   and railroad schedules, and I went out…

   Penny: Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?

   Bernadette: Kind of on Sheldon’s bed.

   Amy: What?

   Penny: No.

   Bernadette: I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on
   his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time
   he said, hey, let’s go in here.

   Amy: How could you do that?

   Bernadette: I’m sorry, but you know what it’s like when you’re
   with your man and one thing leads to another.

   Amy: I do know what that’s like. I really do.

   Scene: The bar.

   Leonard: I’m not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices
   like this.

   Howard: I’m not finding anything either.

   Raj: It’s a good sign.

   Sheldon: Oh, wait, I found something.

   Howard: Damn. What is it?

   Sheldon: This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda
   gets so scared.

   Leonard: Can you focus on what we’re talking about?

   Sheldon: All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but
   as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within
   1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.

   Raj: Even drunk, he’s still smarter than all of us.

   Sheldon: And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the
   bartender?

   Leonard: I’d enjoy that.

   Sheldon: Nah, she’s a good kid.

   Howard: If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and
   license it to companies that make guidance systems.

   Raj: Look at that. You’ve known you’re gonna be a father for
   less than a day and you’re already stepping up.

   Leonard: I’m telling you, you got this.

   Howard: Maybe you’re right.

   Sheldon: Of course he’s right. You and I both know how hard it
   is growing up without a father. That’s why I’m confident you’re
   gonna be the best dad you can be.

   Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all
   kinds of neat experiments on them.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s hot tub.

   Bernadette: You guys can go in if you want.

   Penny: No, we’re a team. If you can’t go in, we’re not going
   in.

   Amy: Then why are we drinking?

   Penny: Okay, it’s not like she’s got the Christ child in there,
   all right? (Checking text) Oh. It’s Leonard. He says Sheldon’s
   drunk and they’re gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.

   Bernadette: That sounds fun.

   Amy: Oh, no. Sheldon’s drunk texting me.

   Penny: What’s it say?

   Amy: Would you like to sing karaoke with us.

   Bernadette: How is that a drunk text?

   Amy: He used a period instead of a question mark. He’s so
   wasted.

   Scene: The bar.

   Raj (rapping): Your movie’s showing, so you’re going. Could
   care less about the five you’re blowing. Theatre gets dark just
   to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row,
   she’s dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me,
   you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose,
   and what comes next, hey, bust a move.

   Leonard (singing): You want it, you got it, oh, you want it,
   baby you got it

   Raj: Just bust a move,

   Leonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got
   it

   Raj: Just bust a move,

   Leonard: You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got
   it

   Penny: Hey, guys. Congratulations.

   Howard: Thank you.

   Amy: Hi. How are you doing?

   Sheldon: Wonderful. I’m being musically encouraged to bust a
   move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.

   Howard: I’m really glad you’re here. Can we talk?

   Bernadette: Sure.

   Penny: So, you gonna get up there later?

   Sheldon: A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of
   Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it?
   You bet I am.

   Howard: I’m sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to
   know I’m done being scared.

   Bernadette: It’s okay to be nervous. I am, too.

   Howard: Thank God, ’cause I was lying, you might not have to
   wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I’m also
   really excited. I mean it.

   Bernadette: Me, too.

   Howard: I love you. Mmm. And I’m not just saying that because
   your breasts are gonna get bigger.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Penny (singing): Are we an item? Girl, quit playin’.

   Amy (singing): We’re just friends, what are you sayin’?

   Penny (singing): Say there’s another and look right in my eyes.

   Amy (singing): My first love broke my heart for the first time.

   Together: And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby,
   baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you’d
   always be mine.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Howard (singing): Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all
   your lovin’. Baby, I need your lovin’, got to have all your
   lovin’.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Raj (singing): Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby,
   baby, baby.

   Leonard (singing): Ah, push it.

   Bernadette: I appreciate this, but you really…

   Leonard (singing): Push it real good.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Sheldon (singing): Land where my fathers died, land of the
   pilgrims’ pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Howard: I’d like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my
   wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you,
   Bernie. (Singing) Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of sayin’
   how much you love me. Havin’ my baby, what a lovely way of
   sayin’ what you’re thinkin’ of me.

   Sheldon: You’re kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in
   someone else’s bedroom?

   Howard: Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: That was such a fun night.

   Leonard: Probably ’cause you got to see your man up there
   rockin’ the mic.

   Penny: Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to
   beat-box.

   Leonard: Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.

   Penny: Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.

   Leonard: Me, too. So, you ever think about it?

   Penny: Babies? Well, I’m not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure.
   What about you?

   Leonard: I think we’d make amazing parents.

   Sheldon: Will you guys keep it down?

   Penny: On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
