Series 1 Episode 05 – The Hamburger Postulate

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory

   Sheldon: Alright, I’m moving my infantry division, augmented by
   a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the
   Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle
   of Gettysburg.

   Howard: Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry
   divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.

   Leonard: No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable
   to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the
   Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.

   Raj: Why don’t you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with
   Shiva and Ganesh.

   Penny: Hi, you guys ready to order?

   Howard: Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods
   against the entire Union army?

   Leonard: And Orcs!

   Penny: I’ll be back.

   Raj: Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva
   is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will
   be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.

   Penny: Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave
   and never come back.

   Howard: What do you recommend for someone who worked up a
   man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and
   cardio-funk?

   Penny: A shower.

   Howard: I’ll take the heart smart platter.

   Penny: Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.

   Sheldon: We don’t eat here, I don’t know what’s good.

   Penny: Well, it’s all good.

   Sheldon: Statistically unlikely.

   Leonard: Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.

   Sheldon: I like the hamburgers where we usually have
   hamburgers, you can’t make the assumption that I’ll like the
   hamburgers here.

   Leonard: I’m sorry. Give him a hamburger.

   Penny: Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House
   Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?

   Sheldon: Can’t we just go to Big Boy? They only have one
   burger. The Big Boy.

   Penny: The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big
   Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?

   Penny: Because you are not at Big Boy!

   Sheldon: Fine, I’ll have the Barbecue Burger.

   Leonard: Make it two.

   Sheldon: Waitresses don’t yell at you at Big Boy.

   Lesley (entering): Hey Leonard, hi guys.

   Leonard: Hey Lesley.

   Lesley: I didn’t know you ate here.

   Sheldon: We don’t. This is a disturbing aberration.

   Leonard: Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from
   Sheldon and me.

   Howard: And walks in quiet beauty like the night.

   Penny: Howard, I’ve asked you not to do that.

   Leonard: Lesley and I do research together at the University.

   Penny: Oh, wow, a girl scientist.

   Lesley: Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I’m
   glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet
   needs a new cellist.

   Leonard: What happened to Elliot Wong?

   Lesley: He switched over to high energy radiation research, had
   a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable
   sitting next to him. So, are you in?

   Leonard: Yeah, sure, why not.

   Lesley: Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.

   Leonard: Why at my place?

   Lesley: Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space
   is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.

   Penny: Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn’t know you played the
   cello?

   Leonard: Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and
   putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me
   beaten up enough.

   Howard: If you’re into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.

   Penny: Really? (Howard performs some of the worst beatboxing
   imaginable.) I’m actually not that into music. So hey, your
   friend’s really cute, anything going on with you two.

   Leonard: Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?

   Sheldon: He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.

   Leonard: Thank you Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?

   Penny: Oh, that’s too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.

   Raj: Oh dear.

   Howard: What’s the matter?

   Raj: She didn’t take my order.

   Howard: How can she take your order when you’re too neurotic to
   talk to her.

   Raj: Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.

   Scene: The stairwell of the apartment building.

   Leonard: What did Penny mean, you’d make a cute couple?

   Sheldon: Well I assume she meant that the two of you together
   would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An
   alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you
   could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made
   Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren’t they adorable.

   Leonard: If Penny didn’t know that Lesley had already turned me
   down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny,
   thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she,
   Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But
   because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she,
   Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering
   consolation. That’s too bad, you would have made a cute couple.
   But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.

   Sheldon: You’re a lucky man, Leonard.

   Leonard: How so?

   Sheldon: You’re talking to one of the three men in the Western
   hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.

   Leonard: Well, what do you think.

   Sheldon: I said I could follow it, I didn’t say I cared.

   Credit sequence.

   Scene: The apartment living room. The string quartet are
   practising.

   Lesley: I admire your fingering.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Lesley: Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument.

   Time jump

   Lesley: Goodnight guys, good job.

   Male string quartettist: Thanks.

   Female string quartettist: See you next week.

   Leonard: That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.

   Lesley: You’re welcome. If you’re up for it we could practise
   that middle section again.

   Leonard: Uh, sure, why not.

   Lesley: Just so we’re clear, you understand that me hanging
   back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know
   that I’m sexually available.

   Leonard: Really?

   Lesley: Yeah, I’m good to go.

   Leonard: I thought you weren’t interested in me.

   Lesley: That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece
   of wood between your legs.

   Leonard: You mean my cello?

   Lesley: No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I’m
   seducing you.

   Leonard: No kidding?

   Lesley: What can I say, I’m a passionate and impulsive woman.
   So how about it?

   Leonard: Gee, uh…

   Lesley: Is it the waitress?

   Leonard: Penny? What about her?

   Lesley: Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you
   looked at her, which, unless you’re a heroin addict, points to
   sexual attraction.

   Leonard: Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast,
   which could give a positive urine test for opiates but
   certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there’s no point in
   bringing it up.

   Lesley: You and the waitress then?

   Leonard: No. No, there’s nothing going on between Penny and me.

   Lesley: So, you’re open to a sexual relationship?

   Leonard: Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.

   Lesley: Good.

   Leonard: Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?

   Lesley: Why don’t we finish the section first.

   Leonard: Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.

   (They play, gradually going faster and faster.)

   Leonard: I’m good, I’m good to go.

   Lesley: Me too. (Exit in direction of bedrooms.)

   Scene: The hallway, Sheldon scuttles out of apartment door and
   crosses to Penny’s. Knocks on it urgently.

   Penny (opening door): Oh, hey Sheldon, what’s going on?

   Sheldon: I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.

   Penny: I’m sorry?

   Sheldon: Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it’s a
   branch of philosophy related to linguistics.

   Penny: Okay, sweetie, I know you think you’re explaining
   yourself, but you’re really not.

   Sheldon: Just come with me.

   Jump to the pair of them standing outside Leonard’s bedroom
   door. Bryan Adams “Have You Ever Loved A Woman” is emerging.
   There is a tie on the bedroom door.

   Sheldon: Well?

   Penny: Well what?

   Sheldon: What does it mean?

   Penny: Oh, come on, you went to college.

   Sheldon: Yes, but I was eleven.

   Penny: Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means
   someone doesn’t want to be disturbed because they’re, you know,
   getting busy.

   Sheldon: So you’re saying Leonard has a girl in there.

   Penny: Well, either that or he’s lost his tie rack and gotten
   really into Bryan Adams.

   Lesley (voice off): Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.

   Penny: We really shouldn’t be standing here.

   Sheldon (entering living room): This is very awkward.

   Penny: Oh, come on, you know, Leonard’s had girls over before,
   right?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, but there’s usually planning, courtship and
   advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the
   Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

   Penny: Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate
   was having sex?

   Sheldon: I didn’t have to, the dates just happened to coincide.

   Penny: So, do you know who’s in there?

   Sheldon: Well, there’s Leonard. (Picking up violin case) And
   he’s either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930’s gangster.

   Penny: Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.

   Sheldon: No, no, wait, hold on.

   Penny: What’s the matter?

   Sheldon: I don’t know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do
   I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?

   Penny: Gee, Sheldon, you’re asking the wrong girl. I’m usually
   on the other side of the tie.

   (Sheldon looks lost for a moment. The pulls out his mobile
   phone and dials.)

   Sheldon: Hi, Leonard. It’s me, Sheldon. In the living room. I
   just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received.
   You’re welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.

   Scene: In Leonard’s Bedroom. Leonard wakes up next to Lesley,
   puts on glasses and grins.

   Scene: Living room, Sheldon is sleeping on the sofa, with his
   head on Lesley’s Violin case.

   Sheldon: Big boy! (Wakes up, looks at watch, wraps self in
   blanket, walks towards kitchen) Someone touched my board. Oh
   God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!

   Leonard (entering): Hey, what’s the matter?

   Sheldon: My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations.

   Leonard: Are you sure?

   Sheldon: Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of
   quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed.

   Leonard: Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been
   having?

   Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you….
   hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having.

   Lesley (entering): You’re welcome.

   Sheldon: You did this?

   Lesley: Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of
   water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are
   asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?

   Sheldon: Cool?

   Lesley: Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.

   Leonard: Thank you, I’ll see you at work.

   Sheldon: Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!

   Lesley: What?

   Sheldon: Who told you you could touch my board?

   Lesley: No-one.

   Sheldon: I don’t come into your house and touch your board.

   Lesley: There are no incorrect equations on my board.

   Sheldon: Oh, that is so… so…

   Lesley: I’m sorry, I’ve got to run, if you come up with an
   adjective, text me. (Leaves).

   Sheldon: Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.

   Scene: The hallway.

   Leonard (exiting the apartment): You can stare at your board
   all day Sheldon, she’s still going to be right.

   Sheldon (inside): I’m not staring, I’m mulling.

   Penny: Oh, hey Leonard.

   Leonard: Oh, hi.

   Penny: So, how’s it going?

   Leonard: Pretty good.

   Penny: Just pretty good, I’d think you were doing very good.

   Leonard: Pretty, very, there’s really no objective scale for
   delineating variations of good, why do you ask?

   Penny: Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked
   up last night.

   Leonard: Sheldon!

   Sheldon: I’m coming.

   Penny: So, is it serious, do you like her?

   Leonard: Wuh, I don’t…. th-th-th-that’s really two different
   questions, uh, I’m not…. Sheldon, we have to go!

   Sheldon: Boy, you’re wound awfully tight for a man who just had
   sexual intercourse.

   Penny: Alright, well, I’ll talk to you later, but, I am so
   happy for you Leonard.

   Leonard: Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is
   she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because
   she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone
   would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their
   happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the
   second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to
   the first person.

   Sheldon: Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with
   your booty call?

   Leonard: You know what, I’m being ridiculous. But who cares
   what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she’s attractive,
   we like each other, she’s extremely intelligent.

   Sheldon: She’s not that intelligent.

   Leonard: She fixed your equation.

   Sheldon: She got lucky.

   Leonard: You don’t believe in luck.

   Sheldon: I don’t have to believe in it for her to be lucky.

   Leonard: Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship
   with Lesley, I’m not going to pass that up for some
   hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not
   want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me
   happy.

   Sheldon: Leonard?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Sheldon: I still don’t care.

   Scene: Leonard and Lesley’s lab.

   Leonard: Hey, Lesley.

   Lesley: Careful  Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below
   zero.

   Leonard: Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.

   Lesley: Because I’ve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn’t find
   a knife.

   Leonard: So anyway (puts arms around her) Hello.

   Lesley: Uh, what are you doing?

   Leonard: Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over
   to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?

   Lesley: Okay, uh, what exactly do you think’s going on between
   us?

   Leonard: I’m not sure, but I think I’m about to discover how
   the banana felt.

   Lesley: Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but
   we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in
   our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You
   stick electrodes in a rat’s brain, give him an orgasm button,
   he’ll push that thing until he starves to death.

   Leonard: Who wouldn’t?

   Lesley: Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that
   you can’t stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That’s where
   you come in.

   Leonard: Yeah, well, I’m just glad to be a part of it. So what
   happens now?

   Lesley: Well, I don’t know about your sex drive, but I’m
   probably good till New Years.

   Leonard: Oh. Okay. Thank you.

   Lesley: Thank you!

   Leonard: You want to make plans for New Years.

   Lesley: Woah, Leonard, please, you’re smothering me.

   Leonard (leaving): Sorry.

   Howard: Hey, look, it’s Doctor Stud!

   Leonard: Doctor what?

   Howard: The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and
   Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.

   Leonard: Wha… how did it get on the internet?

   Howard: I put it there.

   Leonard: Well, how did you know about it?

   Raj: A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent
   beast.

   Leonard: Well, that part’s true!

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.

   Sheldon: You know, I think I may have misjudged this
   restaurant.

   Leonard: No kidding.

   Sheldon: I won’t go out on a limb, but I think we may be
   looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.

   Leonard: Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.

   Sheldon: Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to
   Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.

   Leonard: Really?

   Sheldon: Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup
   Plantation. You can’t grow soup.

   Penny: So, how’s everything.

   Sheldon: Terrific, you’ll be happy to know that I plan to come
   here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.

   Penny: Really, oh yay!

   Sheldon: Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this
   table?

   Penny: Um, I don’t know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things
   with you and Lesley?

   Leonard: Oh, to be honest, I don’t think it’s going to work
   out.

   Penny: Oh, oh that’s too bad. Well hey, don’t worry, I’m sure
   there is someone out there who is just right for you. (Walks
   away smiling).

   Leonard: Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a
   generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?

   Sheldon: You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy?
   This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a
   double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to
   condiment ratio.

   Leonard: Are you even listening to me?

   Sheldon: Of course I’m listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny
   delusion, blah blah blah.

   Leonard: Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for
   soup. (Sheldon nods).
