Series 8 Episode 03 – The First Pitch Insufficiency

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a
   real ball?

   Leonard: Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.

   Howard: All right.

   Raj: You suck, Wolowitz.

   Howard: What’s that about?

   Raj: I’m heckling you. It’s a beloved part of baseball.

   Sheldon: He’s right. And given that you’re probably still
   waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade,
   I’m sure you do suck.

   Penny: Hi. What’s going on?

   Leonard: Baseball.

   Penny: Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside
   and play.

   Leonard: He’s practicing.

   Penny: For what?

   Howard: The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first
   pitch, so guess who they called?

   Penny: What, you? Really?

   Howard: Well, a lot of people who weren’t available, but then
   me.

   Penny: That’s so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you
   the athlete of the group.

   Sheldon: Well, not just him. May I remind you that you’re
   talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the
   third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.

   Penny: I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a
   broomstick between his legs isn’t something you forget.

   Leonard: C’mon now, throw one.

   Howard: All right, here we go.

   Raj: You look like a jackass.

   Howard: Cut it out. You’re hurting my feelings.

   Leonard: Now you know why we’re not outside.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: Did you enjoy my lecture?

   Amy: No, and neither did our waiter.

   Sheldon: Well, if you’re going to serve Cornish game hen, you
   should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be
   prepared to learn it.

   Amy: It’s hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a
   sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.

   Penny: Hey, how was dinner?

   Sheldon: Good, I had Cornish game hen.

   Leonard: Oh, that poor waiter.

   Amy: Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?

   Penny: You guys are going out two nights in a row?

   Sheldon: I missed a number of date nights while I was on my
   train trip, and I’m contractually obligated to make them up
   under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.

   Penny: That’s so hot.

   Amy: It’s better than hot, it’s binding.

   Sheldon: If you’re free tomorrow night, I’d love to have you
   join us on a double date.

   Penny: Aw.

   Amy: You are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two
   dates.

   Sheldon: Oh. Well, then come or don’t. I don’t care.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: I can’t believe you’re sore.

   Howard: Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after
   the game.

   Bernadette: But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing
   air at a TV.

   Howard: For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a
   high five.

   Bernadette: I’m kind of surprised you agreed to do this in
   front of a stadium full of people.

   Howard: They’re doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like
   I couldn’t say no.

   Bernadette: Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice.
   I played a lot of softball growing up.

   Howard: Thank you, that would be great.

   Bernadette: Great. And while we’re at it, maybe we could butch
   up your run for when you head out to the mound.

   Howard: What’s wrong with the way I run?

   Bernadette; Oh, just kidding. Nothing.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Sheldon, I’m surprised you’d choose to go to a pub.

   Sheldon: At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a
   picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing
   it sank like a lead balloon.

   Amy: I then suggested a pub.

   Sheldon: Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw
   online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.

   Leonard: You don’t even like Yorkshire pudding.

   Sheldon: No, it’s yucky, but informing people about the history
   of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.

   Amy: After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero
   margin.

   Leonard: Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of
   bureaucracy alive.

   Sheldon: Ignore them, Amy. They’re just jealous because they’ll
   never have a relationship as good as ours.

   Penny: Isn’t this when he says bazooka or something?

   Sheldon: I wasn’t making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy
   and I have a superior relationship to yours.

   Leonard: You don’t honestly think that, do you?

   Sheldon: Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of
   relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard
   and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay,
   Penny and you.

   Leonard: There isn’t any ranking. And if there were, we
   wouldn’t be at the bottom of it.

   Penny: Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.

   Leonard: That’s the part you have a problem with?

   Penny: Relax.

   Amy: There they go, fighting again. You’d never hear her talk
   that way to Sauvignon Blanc.

   Scene: A gymnasium.

   Raj: So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little
   League?

   Howard: Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my
   dad’s Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.

   Bernadette: All right, the pitcher’s mound in Major League
   Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.

   Howard: Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much
   further?

   Bernadette: Keep going.

   Howard: How about now?

   Bernadette: I’ll let you know.

   Howard: Are you saying stop and we’re just too far away to hear
   you?

   Bernadette: Okay, stop.

   Howard: Are you kidding me?!

   Bernadette: That’s sixty feet.

   Howard: There’s no way this is sixty feet.

   Bernadette: I’m looking at it.

   Howard: You realize this isn’t one of those times I want you to
   exaggerate how long something is.

   Scene: Amy’s car.

   Leonard: Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you
   think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn’t?

   Sheldon: For starters, we enjoy spending time together.

   Leonard: So do we. And I’ve seen you guys ignore each other for
   hours doing totally different things.

   Sheldon: It’s called parallel play.

   Leonard: Yeah, toddlers do that.

   Sheldon: Not as well as we do.

   Leonard: You believe this guy? He has to be the best at
   everything.

   Penny: So what? Why do you even care?

   Sheldon: Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the
   honeymoon’s over.

   Leonard: Whatever. You can’t even go on a date without checking
   your relationship agreement.

   Sheldon: If you’ve got a problem basing a relationship on a
   contract, I’d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that
   entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution.
   And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair
   is still pretty hot today.

   Amy: It’s a good thing I’m not wearing flag underwear right
   now, ’cause there’s about to be a fire.

   Scene: The gym.

   Bernadette: Okay, it’s not that hard. You just look to where
   you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and
   throw it.

   Howard: That’s your help? That’s like saying here’s how you fly
   a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly
   it.

   Bernadette: Just throw the ball. Let’s see what we’re working
   with.

   Raj: Come on Howard, fire it in.

   Bernadette: Throw the damn ball!

   Scene: The pub.

   Amy: So when do you guys plan on getting married?

   Penny: Uh, we’re not sure. But I want to wait long enough to
   prove to my mother I’m not pregnant.

   Sheldon: May I have one of your fries?

   Amy: Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?

   Sheldon: Absolutely not.

   Leonard: Some perfect couple. He won’t even share his food with
   her.

   Sheldon: It has avocado on it. She’s allergic to avocado. Are
   you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?

   Leonard: I’m not jealous. I just think it’s silly for you to
   compare relationships like they’re something that can be
   quantified.

   Sheldon: Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven.
   Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.

   Leonard: How ridiculous is he?

   Penny: A hundred.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you’re just assigning random numbers to
   things based on your opinion.

   Sheldon: No, I’m not. French fries have three variables,
   crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only
   gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I’d order a clown
   wig.

   Penny: Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French
   fry.

   Sheldon: Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and
   Omoto.

   Penny: Oh, what did those rascals do now?

   Amy: They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which
   predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.

   Sheldon: Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness
   Inventory. That’s pure Cooper.

   Leonard: So, this is accurate?

   Sheldon: It’s been around for 25 years, and has been
   extensively corroborated by other researchers.

   Penny: Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.

   Sheldon: Kind of? It does it perfectly.

   Amy: Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.

   Leonard: Fine. We’ll take it right now.

   Penny: No, don’t.

   Leonard: What?

   Penny: Just don’t take it.

   Leonard: Why not?

   Penny: ‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is?

   Leonard: Come on. It’ll be fun.

   Penny: I said I don’t want you to. I’m getting another drink.

   Leonard: Sorry.

   Amy: I’m gonna let you count this as two dates. They’re a lot
   of work.

   Scene: The gym.

   Bernadette: Think he’s getting any better?

   Raj: Yup.

   Howard: That was a close one.

   Bernadette: Okay.

   Raj: Is it too late for him to cancel?

   Bernadette: I think so.

   Howard: Heads up! Watch out!

   Scene: The pub.

   Leonard: Are you mad at me?

   Penny: No, stop being stupid.

   Leonard: Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?

   Penny: Look, I don’t need a score on a test to make me worry
   about something I’m already worried about.

   Leonard: What are you worried about?

   Penny: That we’re engaged and have nothing in common, and it
   scares me.

   Leonard: Yeah, that scares me, too.

   Penny: It does?

   Leonard: Sometimes.

   Penny: Well, that’s not good. You being blindly infatuated with
   me was the rock we were building this relationship on.

   Leonard: Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we’re
   both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so,
   that’s something that we have in common. Also, we both think
   I’m not funny. Huh? See, you’re not laughing.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Mike (on Skype): Hey, Froot Loops, what’s up?

   Howard: Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first
   pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?

   Mike: Yeah. Don’t do it. What else you up to?

   Howard: Why shouldn’t I do it?

   Mike: There’s no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if
   you screw up, you’re an idiot on YouTube forever.

   Howard: But it’s for a good cause. What about all the kids
   that’ll be there?

   Mike: That’s what I’m telling you. Kids are the worst. My own
   daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.

   Howard: Well, maybe I’ll do a good job.

   Mike: I don’t know. In space, you couldn’t even toss me a pen,
   and that was in zero gravity.

   Howard: Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

   Mike: Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She’s
   so much cuter than you, I don’t know how you ever got her.

   Bernadette: He’s so nice.

   Scene: The pub.

   Penny: Hey, sorry about that.

   Amy: No, we’re sorry. We never should have been comparing
   relationships in the first place.

   Sheldon: Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on
   Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.

   Leonard: I just want to say one more thing about this. Just
   because Penny and I are very different people does not mean
   that we’re a bad couple.

   Sheldon: The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know,
   it’s like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I
   sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick
   and a bag.

   Leonard: I killed his Chewbacca slippers.

   Penny: Let’s just take the test.

   Leonard: No, no, no, I don’t want to.

   Penny: Oh, well, ’cause you know we’re gonna do bad.

   Leonard: Because it doesn’t matter. I don’t care if we’re a ten
   or a two.

   Sheldon: Or a one. A one is possible.

   Leonard: Marriage is scary. You’re scared, I’m scared. But it
   doesn’t make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to
   hold your hand and do it with you.

   Penny: Leonard.

   Amy: It would make me so happy if you said things like that.

   Sheldon: We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you’re happy.

   Scene: Angels Stadium

   Raj: Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It
   really ties the whole stadium together.

   Penny: Look at you, talking sports.

   Leonard: This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out
   the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.

   Sheldon: Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.

   Amy: Sheldon, what did you expect?

   Sheldon: I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my
   hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just
   in time for Mickey’s Soundsational Parade.

   Amy: I’ll tell you what. If we stay, I’ll buy you cotton candy
   and a bobblehead.

   Sheldon: Who’s the bobblehead of?

   Amy: Does it matter?

   Sheldon: No, as long as it bobbles.

   Bernadette: Howie, I am so proud of you.

   Howard: Thanks. I’m proud of me, too.

   Man: You ready?

   Howard: Let’s do it.

   Man: All right.

   Howard: Wish me luck.

   Bernadette: Go get ’em.

   Stadium Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day
   at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA
   astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

   Howard: Thank you. Thank you.

   Penny: Can he really throw a ball?

   Leonard: On our Quidditch team, he…

   Penny: Yeah, that’s a no.

   Howard: I have a message for the young people here today. When
   I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head
   said I couldn’t do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you
   know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered
   that I’m not an athlete. I’m a scientist. So, today’s first
   pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and
   gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype
   of the Mars Rover. And here’s the wind-up, and the pitch.

   Bernadette: Why is it going so slow?

   Howard: ‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through.

   Sheldon: Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and
   seek on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and then come back and see the end
   of the pitch.

   Howard: Okay, while we’re waiting for the ball to arrive,
   here’s some fun facts about Mars.

   Man in Crowd: You suck, Wolowitz!

   Sheldon: He makes a valid point.

   Howard: Okay, booing isn’t gonna make it go any faster.
