Series 6 Episode 15 – The Spoiler Alert Segmentation

   Scene: The apartment

   Leonard: I don’t know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for
   so long. These are great. I just started number six.

   Sheldon: That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah,
   I know, I didn’t see it coming, either.

   Leonard: Why would you say that?

   Sheldon: You brought up the subject. I contributed an
   interesting fact on that subject. It’s called the art of
   conversation. Okay, your turn.

   Leonard: That was a huge spoiler.

   Sheldon: Good.

   Leonard: What is wrong with you? If I did that, you’d bitch
   about it for weeks.

   Sheldon: Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one
   of your hissy fits?

   Leonard: Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?

   Sheldon: Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose
   intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains
   estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs
   are turning you into a hysterical woman.

   Leonard: You are unbelievable. I don’t know why I put up with
   you. You’re controlling, you’re irritating.

   Sheldon: There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You’re only proving
   my point, little lady.

   Leonard: You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most
   annoying person I have ever met.

   Sheldon: What? I’m annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the
   time. Sheldon, don’t talk about your bowel movements over
   breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is
   giving a eulogy at a funeral, don’t yawn and point at your
   watch. Sheldon, don’t throw away my shirts ’cause you think
   they’re ugly. You’re impossible.

   Leonard: That’s it. I don’t, I don’t have to put up with this.

   Sheldon: Actually, I have your signature on a roommate
   agreement that says you do.

   Leonard: Aw. Here’s what I think of your roommate agreement.

   Sheldon: You pick that up right now.

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the
   roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the
   ground.

   Leonard: I don’t care. I don’t have to do anything you say
   because I don’t think I want to live here anymore.

   Sheldon: Where are you going?

   Leonard: To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.

   Sheldon: Crazy bastard?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: Leonard, wait.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: Dobby the elf dies in book seven.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Raj: Here you go.

   Howard: Great. Come on in.

   Raj: What, you don’t say thank you?

   Howard: It’s my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.

   Raj: Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the
   handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette’s company going to
   Vegas?

   Howard: No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It’s
   part of a bonus she got.

   Raj: Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?

   Howard: Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this
   dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal
   leakage.

   Raj: Is there a good anal leakage?

   Howard: Anyway, it was Bernie’s idea to rebrand the stuff as a
   cure for constipation.

   Raj: Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner
   where fudge is made.

   Howard: Hey, I got a favour to ask.

   Raj: Sure.

   Howard: My mom’s been kind of an emotional wreck since that
   dentist she was dating dumped her.

   Raj: Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There’s
   nothing funny about morbid obesity.

   Howard: She’s huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping
   that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make
   sure she’s doing okay.

   Raj: Dude, I’m a single man. Saturday night is my party night.

   Howard: Really? What do you got going on?

   Raj: I don’t know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot
   spots, see if I can get lucky.

   Howard: Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen
   dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until
   you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in.
   You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen
   dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and
   imagine your perfect life together. Your children,
   grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he
   wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever
   loving you, go to Marie Callender’s, buy a pie and eat it in
   your car in the parking lot.

   Raj:What time should I be at your mother’s?

   Howard: I told her around seven.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: I swear, that man is the most egotistical,
   insufferable human being I have ever met.

   Penny: Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and
   Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.

   Leonard: Well, I’ve had it. I am done. I can’t, I can’t live
   with him for one more minute.

   Penny: Wow. Where are you going to go?

   Leonard: I was thinking here with you.

   Penny: Oh.

   Leonard: That a problem?

   Penny: No, not at all. No, it’s, it’s great. It’s terrific. I,
   you know, I just can’t help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean,
   how’s he going to get by without you? Ernie.

   Leonard: He’s got Amy now.

   Penny: Yeah, he does, but it’s not the same.

   Leonard: Why?

   Penny: Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry
   Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn’t abandon Harry just
   because Harry started dating Ron’s sister?

   Leonard: Harry and Ginny get together?

   Penny: Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to
   live with you, I can’t do it knowing how much Sheldon needs
   you.

   Leonard: Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his
   whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.

   Penny: Well, you know what they say, if it ain’t broke.

   Leonard: Wow. It sounds to me like you don’t want us to live
   together.

   Penny: No. No, no, I do. I do. It’s just, I mean, it’s a really
   big step.

   Leonard: Is it? We’re together all the time. Financially, it
   makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn’t
   do this?

   Penny: Well, um, I’m just a little thirsty.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: I got nothing.

   Leonard: Great. I’ll go get my stuff.

   Penny: Yeah. Okay, all right, don’t freak out. You can make
   this work.

   Leonard: Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the
   bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.

   Penny: Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Are you ready for dessert?

   Raj: No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I’m going to have
   to carry my stomach out of here like I’m a fireman rescuing an
   infant.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, please. You’re a tall glass of brown
   water. Have dessert.

   Raj: Well, I, I really couldn’t. But, uh, I’ve had a lovely
   time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you’ve
   had removed from your body over the years. Didn’t know you
   could have a cyst inside another cyst.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): The doctor said they were like Russian
   nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a
   little doggie bag together for you?

   Raj: That would be lovely. Thank you. (Sound of crying) Mrs.
   Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Don’t mind me. I just cry when I’m lonely
   and have nothing to live for.

   Raj: I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?

   Raj: Sure.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): I’ll make one.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That’s
   Leonard’s.

   Amy: Children’s toy.

   Sheldon: One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. That’s
   Leonard’s.

   Amy: Children’s toy.

   Sheldon: One Game of Thrones collector’s edition Longclaw
   sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That’s a bit of
   an ethical conundrum. Eh, I’ll keep it.

   Amy: So, uh, what’s your plan moving forward?

   Sheldon: Uh, suppose I’ll have to find and cultivate a new
   roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized
   Leonard was when I took him in?

   Amy: No.

   Sheldon: Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom
   schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.

   Amy: Like a dog-boy.

   Sheldon: Exactly.

   Amy: What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and
   already familiar and comfortable with your ways?

   Sheldon: That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I
   would sign on, no further questions asked.

   Amy: Great. Here I am!

   Sheldon: Wait. Here who is where?

   Amy: Me. Aren’t I your perfect roommate?

   Sheldon: Um…

   Amy: Think about it, Sheldon. I’m not a stranger, we’re
   intellectually compatible, I’m willing to chauffeur you around
   town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent
   or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?

   Sheldon: Um…

   Amy: Tell me one reason why this isn’t a fantastic idea.

   Sheldon: Um…

   Amy: See? You can’t. I’m gonna go see if Leonard’s room is big
   enough for my water bed.

   Sheldon: Um…

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock,
   knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good
   buddy Leonard.

   Leonard: What do you want?

   Sheldon: Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy,
   and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you
   and me is much ado about nothing.

   Leonard: Is that so?

   Sheldon: Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I’ll make you
   some soy hot chocolate, and then I’ll you tell you about our
   exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.

   Leonard: Cut to the chase, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Okay. Amy’s decided she wants to move in with me, so I
   need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That’s a lot of
   product.

   Penny: Hey. What’s going on?

   Leonard: Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because
   Amy wants to move in with him.

   Penny: Really? Interesting.

   Leonard: Well, too late, pal. I’m not going anywhere. Penny and
   I are very happy living together. Isn’t that right?

   Penny: It’s like the happiness won’t ever leave the apartment.

   Sheldon: Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level
   of intimacy our relationship isn’t ready for.

   Penny: Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn’t mean you don’t
   care about each other, it just means things are moving at a
   pace you’re not comfortable with, and that’s fine.

   Leonard: Well, if he doesn’t want to live with her, then he
   should tell her how he feels.

   Penny: Well, maybe he doesn’t know how to say it without
   hurting her feelings.

   Sheldon: Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The
   problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I
   couldn’t refute.

   Penny: That is the worst, isn’t it?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Leonard: I’m sorry, Sheldon. I can’t help you. Oh, spoiler
   alert, this door’s about to slam in your face.

   Amy: Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?

   Sheldon: Um…

   Scene: Howard’s old bedroom. A phone is ringing.

   Raj: Hello?

   Howard: Hey. How’d it go last night with my mom?

   Raj: Okay, I guess.

   Howard: What time did you leave?

   Raj: Actually, I’m still here.

   Howard: What? You spent the night?

   Raj: Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford
   Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and
   the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.

   Howard: You wore my pyjamas?

   Raj: Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on
   satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?

   Raj: Oh, boy. Breakfast.

   Howard: Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.

   Raj: But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.

   Howard: If you don’t leave now, she’ll use food and guilt to
   keep you there for the rest of your life.

   Raj: Oh, Howard, stop.

   Howard: Trust me, you’re not Jewish. That’s how they get you.

   Raj: You’re being silly. I can leave whenever I want.

   Howard: Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?

   Raj: They’re on the chair, right over… Oy vey.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: Hello, home wrecker.

   Penny: What did I do?

   Sheldon: You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy’s
   out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I’d ever dry myself
   with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.

   Penny: Okay. Listen, the truth is I don’t want him living with
   me.

   Sheldon: Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.

   Penny: No, I don’t want to break his heart. I love him. This is
   just happening too fast.

   Sheldon: You think this is fast? It’s just a matter of time
   before I see Amy’s leg stubble in my shower.

   Penny: Yeah, and I’ve seen those legs. You might want to get
   some Drano.

   Sheldon: Hold on. If you don’t want to live with Leonard, why
   don’t you just tell him?

   Penny: Well, you know how he is. He’s sensitive and emotional.

   Sheldon: That’s because he drinks too much soy milk.

   Penny: Well, I don’t know what else we can do but tell them the
   truth.

   Sheldon: I suppose there’s no choice but to face the crying,
   angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.

   Penny: Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.

   Scene: A hotel room.

   Howard: Here’s some more ice.

   Bernadette: Oh, thanks.

   Howard: What were we thinking? We should have just done it the
   regular way.

   Bernadette: Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it
   look so easy.

   Howard: Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need
   with you?

   Bernadette: If you could bend that far, you’d be doing us both
   a favour. (Phone)

   Howard: Hey, Raj. What’s up?

   Raj: You were right. I can’t get out of here.

   Howard: You’re still at my mother’s?

   Raj: I’m trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day,
   and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because
   she jingles when she walks. What do I do?

   Howard: Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.

   Raj: Come on, Howard, help me.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.

   Raj: Oh, my God. She’s not gonna bathe me, is she?

   Howard: Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well,
   thanks again for helping me out.

   Raj: But, Howard…

   Bernadette: Should we go back and rescue him?

   Howard: It’s too late. We’ll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way
   Leonard used to.

   Sheldon: Is it kung pao chicken?

   Amy: Yes.

   Sheldon: Brown rice, not white rice?

   Amy: Yes.

   Sheldon: Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?

   Amy: Yes. I did good, right?

   Sheldon: Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will
   take the mystery out of our relationship?

   Amy: No.

   Sheldon: Yeah, why would you?

   Amy: Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of
   scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.

   Sheldon: Hello. This is Sheldon.

   Amy: And this is Amy.

   Sheldon: We’re not home right now.

   Amy: ‘Cause we out dropping science, son.

   Together: Leave a message.

   Amy: Beep.

   Sheldon: You can’t live here.

   Amy: What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to
   sound tough so people wouldn’t break in.

   Sheldon: No. It’s not the message.

   Amy: Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you
   like it.

   Sheldon: You did.

   Amy: Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for
   over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I
   watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous
   contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ’cause you said it
   made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend
   you’re ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can’t
   live here.

   Sheldon: It’s Penny’s fault.

   Amy: What?

   Sheldon: She doesn’t want to live with Leonard, so he has to
   come live here again. She’s the snake in our garden. She’s the
   reason we can’t be happy.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Hey, Ames.

   Amy: Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with
   Sheldon, and now I hear I can’t ’cause you don’t want to live
   with Leonard.

   Leonard (off): What?

   Penny: Sheldon, what did you say?

   Sheldon: I said the truth. You don’t want to live with Leonard,
   and you know it.

   Leonard: Since when don’t you want to live with me?

   Penny: Oh, don’t get all huffy. You’re the one who decided to
   move in without even asking me if I was ready.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I think we should talk about that.

   Penny: And since you love the truth so much, why don’t you tell
   Amy you don’t want to live with her instead of blaming it on
   me?

   Sheldon: I thought we were talking about the other thing.

   Amy: You’re a coward.

   Sheldon: Well, the evidence does support that.

   Penny: Come on, Amy, let’s go drink wine and talk about what
   jerks our boyfriends are.

   Amy: You know what would show them? I should move in here with
   you.

   Penny: Um…

   Sheldon: Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?

   Leonard: ‘Kay.

   Sheldon: Have you seen the one where Lori dies?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Or maybe she doesn’t. Let’s find out.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house. Raj is climbing out of the window.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where you going?

   Raj (screams): No!
