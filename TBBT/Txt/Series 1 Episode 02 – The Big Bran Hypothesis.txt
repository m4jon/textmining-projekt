Series 1 Episode 02 – The Big Bran Hypothesis

   Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment. Sheldon, Leonard,
   Howard and Raj are present.

   Leonard: There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.

   Howard: But does it have peanut oil?

   Leonard: Uh, I’m not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in
   case he starts to swell up.

   Sheldon: Since it’s not bee season, you can have my
   epinephrine.

   Raj: Are there any chopsticks?

   Sheldon: You don’t need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

   Leonard: Here we go.

   Sheldon: Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the
   nineteenth century. Interestingly they don’t actually put the
   fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon
   which then goes into their mouth.

   Leonard: Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. (There is a knock on
   the door.) I’ll get it.

   Howard: Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

   (Leonard opens door to Penny, steps into hallway)

   Penny: Hey Leonard.

   Leonard: Oh, hi Penny.

   Penny: Am I interrupting.

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon (off): You’re not swelling, Howard.

   Howard (off): No, no, look at my fingers, they’re like Vienna
   sausages.

   Penny: Sounds like you have company.

   Leonard: They’re not going anywhere. (Closes door, staying in
   hallway.) So, you’re coming home from work. That’s great. How
   was work.

   Penny: Well, you know, it’s the Cheesecake Factory. People
   order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.

   Leonard: So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.

   Penny: Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage.
   Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with
   something, I was….

   Leonard: Yes.

   Penny: Oh. Okay, great, I’m having some furniture delivered
   tomorrow, and I may not be here, so…. (apartment door opens,
   Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear) Oh! Hel…hello!

   Howard: (speaks a phrase in Russian).

   Penny: I’m sorry?

   Howard: Haven’t you ever been told how beautiful you are in
   flawless Russian?

   Penny: No, I haven’t.

   Howard: Get used to it.

   Penny: Yeah, I probably won’t, but… Hey Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Hi.

   Penny: Hey Raj! (Raj looks uncomfortable) Still not talking to
   me, huh?

   Sheldon: Don’t take it personally, it’s his pathology, he can’t
   talk to women.

   Howard: He can’t talk to attractive women, or in your case a
   cheesecake–scented Goddess!

   Leonard: So, there’s gonna be some furniture delivered?

   Penny: Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I’m not here tomorrow
   could you just sign for it and have them put it in my
   apartment.

   Leonard: Yeah, no problem.

   Penny: Great, here’s my spare key. Thank you.

   Leonard: Penny, wait.

   Penny: Yeah?

   Leonard: Um, if you don’t have any other plans, do you want to
   join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?

   Penny: A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?

   Sheldon: You’re kidding, right?

   Penny: Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the
   helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which
   one was that?

   Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together: One. (Raj raises one
   finger).

   Sheldon: You realise that scene was rife with scientific
   inaccuracy.

   Penny: Yes, I know, men can’t fly.

   Sheldon: Oh no, let’s assume that they can. Lois Lane is
   falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second
   per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out
   two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at
   approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately
   sliced into three equal pieces.

   Leonard: Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.

   Sheldon: In what space, sir, in what space? She’s two feet
   above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he’d let her
   hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.

   Leonard: Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the
   assumption that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength.

   Sheldon: Are you listening to yourself, it is well established
   that Superman’s flight is a feat of strength, it is an
   extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he
   derives from Earth’s yellow Sun.

   Howard: Yeah, and you don’t have a problem with that, how does
   he fly at night.

   Sheldon: Uh, a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and
   the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.

   Penny: I’m just going to go wash up.

   Leonard: I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge
   you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.

   Sheldon: Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We’re locked out.

   Raj: Also, the pretty girl left.

   Credit sequence.

   Scene: Ground floor hallway of the apartment building. Leonard
   is signing for the delivery.

   Leonard: Okay, her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the
   elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to (delivery man
   leaves) oh, you’re just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I
   guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves.

   Sheldon: I hardly think so.

   Leonard: Why not?

   Sheldon: Well, we don’t have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any
   measurable upper body strength.

   Leonard: We don’t need strength, we’re physicists. We are the
   intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a
   lever and I can move the Earth, it’s just a matter… (starts to
   move package) I don’t have this… I don’t have this I don’t have
   this.

   Sheldon: Archimedes would be so proud.

   Leonard: Do you have any ideas?

   Sheldon: Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power
   ring.

   Time shift, Leonard and Sheldon are now lowering the package
   onto the bottom of the stairs.

   Leonard: Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we’ve got an
   inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the
   sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so
   about half.

   Sheldon: Exactly half.

   Leonard (snarkily): Exactly half. Let’s push. Okay, see, it’s
   moving, this is easy, all in the math.

   Sheldon: What’s your formula for the corner.

   Leonard: What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come
   up here and help me pull and turn.

   (Sheldon heads up the stairs. The package slides back down to
   the bottom.)

   Sheldon: Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.

   Time shift, they now have the package on an upstairs hallway,
   not their own.

   Sheldon: You do understand that our efforts here will in no way
   increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this
   woman?

   Leonard: Men do things for women without expecting sex.

   Sheldon: Yeah, those are men who just had sex.

   Leonard: I’m doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case,
   there’s no way it could lower the odds.

   Quick cut to the hallway of their floor, they are nearing the
   top of the staircase.

   Leonard: Almost there, almost there, almost there. (Lets go of
   package, it starts to slip down)

   Sheldon: No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not.

   Scene: Inside Penny’s apartment. They are laying the package
   down on the floor.

   Sheldon: Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my
   fingers!

   Leonard: You okay?

   Sheldon: No, it hurt… (looking around) Great Caesar’s Ghost,
   look at this place?

   Leonard: So Penny’s a little messy.

   Sheldon: A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers
   is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an
   organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is
   valid. I’m just inferring that this is a couch, because the
   evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale.

   Leonard: Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the
   compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world
   around them?

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: Well they don’t. Hard as it may be for you to believe,
   most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by
   fibre content.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful
   at times.

   Leonard: Come on, we should go.

   Sheldon: Hang on.

   Leonard: What are you doing?

   Sheldon: Straightening up.

   Leonard: Sheldon, this is not your home.

   Sheldon: This is not anyone’s home, this is a swirling vortex
   of entropy.

   Leonard: When the transvestite lived here, you didn’t care how
   he kept the place.

   Sheldon: Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man’s
   closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses,
   then his police uniforms.

   Leonard: What were you doing in his closet?

   Sheldon: I helped run some cable for a webcam.

   Penny (entering): Hey guys.

   Leonard: Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this
   up, just now.

   Penny: Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?

   Sheldon: (sucks in breath)

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: No?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: Well, we’ll get out of your hair.

   Penny: Oh, great, thank you again (she throws her jacket over
   the back of the sofa).

   Sheldon: Penny, I just want you to know that, you don’t have to
   live like this. I’m here for you.

   Penny: What’s he talking about?

   Leonard: It’s a joke.

   Penny: I don’t get it.

   Leonard: Yeah, he didn’t tell it right.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom, he is asleep. Sound of door opening
   and closing somewhere else is heard. Leonard wakes, puts on his
   glasses and looks at the clock. It is 2:16.

   Leonard: Sheldon?

   Scene: The living room. Leonard enters carrying a light sabre.

   Leonard: Sheldon? Hello?

   (Notices front door is open, turns off light sabre.)

   Scene: Penny’s apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is
   cleaning. Leonard enters.

   Leonard: Sheldon!

   Sheldon: Sssshhhh! Penny’s sleeping.

   Leonard: Are you insane, you can’t just break into a woman’s
   apartment in the middle of the night and clean.

   Sheldon: I had no choice. I couldn’t sleep knowing that just
   outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our
   living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that
   hallway was… this.

   Leonard: Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no
   reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?

   Sheldon: I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

   Leonard: No, no. You gave me an explanation, it’s
   reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.

   Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous. I have no peers.

   Leonard: Sheldon, we have to get out of here.

   (Penny snores)

   Sheldon: You might want to speak in a lower register.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched
   noises while they sleep, so that they’ll be roused by a crying
   baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower
   register.

   Leonard: That’s ridiculous. (Penny snores again.)

   Sheldon: No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that’s
   ridiculous.

   Leonard (doing likewise): Fine. I accept your premise, now
   please let’s go.

   Sheldon: I am not leaving until I’m done.

   Leonard: O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).

   Sheldon: If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.

   Leonard: Oh, what the hell.

   Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s living room, morning. Sheldon
   enters, singing to himself.

   Sheldon: Morning.

   Leonard: Morning.

   Sheldon: I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long,
   but just deeply and well.

   Leonard: I’m not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia
   is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean.

   Sheldon: Sarcasm?

   Leonard: You think?

   Sheldon: Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox,
   but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of
   Penny’s quality of life.

   Leonard: You know what, you’ve convinced me, maybe tonight we
   should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

   Sheldon: You don’t think that crosses a line?

   Leonard: Yes! For God’s sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a
   sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.

   Sheldon: You have a sarcasm sign?

   Leonard: No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

   Sheldon: Do you want some cereal. I’m feeling so good today I’m
   going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello,
   Honey Puffs.

   Penny (voice off): Son of a Bitch!

   Leonard: Penny’s up.

   Penny (voice off): You sick, geeky bastards!

   Leonard: How did she know it was us?

   Sheldon: I may have left a suggested organisational schematic
   for her bedroom closet.

   Penny (voice off): Leonard!

   Leonard: God, this is going to be bad.

   Sheldon: Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.

   Penny (entering): You came into my apartment last night when I
   was sleeping?

   Leonard: Yes, but, only to clean.

   Sheldon: Really more to organise, you’re not actually dirty,
   per se.

   Penny: Give me back my key.

   Leonard: I’m very, very sorry.

   Penny: Do you understand how creepy this is.

   Leonard: Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.

   Penny: In my apartment, while I was sleeping.

   Sheldon: And snoring. And that’s probably just a sinus
   infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see
   an otolaryngologist. It’s a throat doctor.

   Penny: And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?

   Sheldon: Depending on the depth, that’s either a proctologist
   or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading
   “Sarcasm”) Oh!

   Penny: God!

   Leonard: Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you’re feeling is
   perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you’re
   feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated,
   maybe we could talk about this some more.

   Penny: Stay away from me.

   Leonard: Sure, that’s another way to go.

   Sheldon: Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a
   discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our
   presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you
   also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.
   (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a
   little non-responsive.

   Leonard: You are going to march yourself over there right now
   and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What’s funny?

   Sheldon: That wasn’t sarcasm?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.
   (Knocks on Penny’s door.) I have a masters and two PhD’s, I
   should not have to do this.

   Penny (opening door): What?

   Sheldon: I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take
   full responsibility. And I hope that it won’t colour your
   opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also,
   I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his
   face.) I did what I could.

   Scene: The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets
   Penny who is going down.

   Penny: Hey Raj. (Raj stands looking uncomfortable.) Hey,
   listen, I don’t know if you heard about what happened last
   night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I’m really upset about it,
   I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then
   they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is
   that?

   Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk): Ooh, she’s
   standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is
   that, vanilla?

   Penny: You know, where I come from, someone comes into your
   house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don’t shoot to wound.
   I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an
   accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?

   Raj (internally): She’s so chatty. Maybe my parents are right.
   Maybe I’d be better off with an Indian girl. We’d have the same
   cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the
   same lullabies my mother sang to me.

   Penny: It’s obvious that they meant well, but I’m just, I’m
   having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my
   boyfriend, and it’s just freaking me out.

   Raj (internally sings an Indian lullaby.)

   Penny: I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my
   life happen to be jerks, doesn’t mean I should just assume
   Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?

   Raj (internally): She asked me a question. I should probably
   nod. (Does.)

   Penny: That’s exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening.
   You’re a doll. (She hugs him.)

   Raj (internally): Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. (Does.)

   Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s living room. Howard is there,
   playing on a dance video game.

   Howard (jumping off game mat): Grab a napkin, homie. You just
   got served.

   Leonard: It’s fine. You win.

   Howard: What’s his problem?

   Sheldon: His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.

   Howard: Been there.

   Raj (entering): Hello. Sorry I’m late. But I was in the
   hallway, chatting up Penny.

   Howard: Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?

   Raj: Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.

   Leonard: What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

   Raj: Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her
   sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and…
   then she hugged me.

   Howard: She hugged you? How did she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard.)
   Is that her perfume I smell?

   Raj: intoxicating, isn’t it?

   Scene: The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny’s door. It
   opens.

   Penny: Hi.

   Leonard: Oh.

   Penny: What’s going on?

   Leonard: Um, here’s the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just
   as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first
   atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at
   the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the
   great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s
   mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of
   Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even
   though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation
   poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….

   Penny: Leonard.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny (hugs him): We’re okay. (Kisses him on cheek. Closes
   door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and
   straight into the apartment door.)

   Scene: Penny’s apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to
   construct furniture.

   Leonard: Six two inch dowels.

   Sheldon: Check.

   Leonard: One package, Phillips head screws.

   Sheldon: Check.

   Penny: Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a
   tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put
   together a cheap Swedish media centre.

   Leonard: No, please, we insist, it’s the least we can do
   considering.

   Sheldon: Considering what? How great this place looks?

   Howard (across room with Raj): Oh boy, I was afraid of this.

   Leonard: What?

   Howard: These instructions are a pictographic representation of
   the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This
   right here is why Sweden has no space program.

   Penny: Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.

   Leonard: It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a
   flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.

   Sheldon: We could put her stereo back there.

   Leonard: And control it how?

   Sheldon: Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter
   here, easy peasy.

   Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): Good point, how you
   gonna cool it?

   Penny: Hey guys, I got this.

   Sheldon: Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?

   Leonard: Also inefficient, and might be loud.

   Howard: How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump
   here, run some quarter inch PVC…

   Penny: Guys, this is actually really simple.

   Howard: Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here,
   maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

   Leonard: Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice
   and an overflow reservoir?

   Sheldon: And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground
   the crap out of the thing.

   Penny: Guys, it’s hot in here, I think I’ll just take off all
   my clothes.

   Leonard: Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B
   and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium.

   Sheldon: Right, then the entire thing’s one big heat sink.

   Howard: Perfect, Leonard, why don’t you and Sheldon go down to
   the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap
   aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the
   oxy-acetaline torch.

   Leonard: Meet back here in an hour?

   Howard: Done.

   Leonard: Got it. (They all leave).

   Penny: Okay, this place does look pretty good.
