Series 2 Episode 21 – The Vegas Renormalization

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?

   Leonard: Yes

   Howard: Were you in the original trilogy?

   Leonard: Yes

   Howard: Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal
   bikini?

   Leonard: God, I hope not. And no, I’m not Princess Leia.

   Raj: Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars
   movies?

   Leonard: Yes

   Raj: Interesting. Are you a Droid?

   Leonard: Yes

   Raj: Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?

   Leonard: Yes

   Raj: C3PO.

   Leonard: You got it.

   Sheldon: That’s preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don’t get
   me wrong, I’m flattered, I just don’t see it.

   Howard (phone rings): Leslie Winkle. You’ve reached friends
   with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.

   Sheldon: What exactly does that expression mean, friends with
   benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?

   Leonard: No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with
   someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you
   wanted.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, I can’t imagine any of that.

   Leonard: Alright, back to the game.

   Sheldon: I believe it’s my turn, you may begin your questions
   whenever you’re ready.

   Raj: Are you Spock?

   Sheldon: I don’t like this game.

   Howard: So, where were we?

   Raj: Aren’t you leaving for your booty call?

   Howard: No, it was something else. Why does everything have to
   be about sex with you? Come on. Who’s turn is it?

   Leonard: We were up to you.

   Howard: Great, just start.

   Leonard: Okay, let’s see. Are you from a TV series?

   Howard: She dumped me!

   Sheldon: I bet he’s someone from Babylon 5, we’re never going
   to guess.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: A few moments later.

   Raj: What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?

   Howard: I don’t know. She just said Howard, momma’s a rolling
   stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.

   Sheldon: I don’t understand. If you were in a non-emotional
   relationship then why are you having  what appears be an
   emotional response?

   Leonard: Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.

   Howard: Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for
   God’s sake!

   Leonard: Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it.
   Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a
   movie?

   Howard: I don’t want to go anywhere.

   Sheldon: You know, I’m given to understand that there is an
   entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like
   Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with
   new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and
   sexually transmitted diseases.

   Raj: Is it me, or was that Sheldon’s way of saying Vegas baby!

   Leonard: I’ve never been there, have you?

   Raj: Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in
   Swingers. .

   Howard: It could be fun. I know my weekend’s wide open, now
   that…

   Leonard: Okay, then let’s do this, lets go to Las Vegas.

   Howard: Now? Right now?

   Leonard: Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why
   can’t we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we’ll
   be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill
   a prescription, but after that we’ll go right now.

   Raj: What do you say, Howard?

   Howard: I say Vegas baby!

   Raj: What are you going to tell your mother?

   Howard: Sea World, baby!

   Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?

   Sheldon: I’d rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in
   my auditory canal.

   Leonard: Great, we’ll bring you back a tee-shirt.

   Scene: The lobby.

   Sheldon: Thank you. Hello, neighbour.

   Penny: Hello, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: And how are you doing this fine evening?

   Penny: Great.

   Sheldon: Good. I’m glad.

   Penny: Really? Are you drunk?

   Sheldon: I’m just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in
   Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal
   Fortress of Solitude.

   Penny: That’s Superman’s big ice thing, right?

   Sheldon: Do you know, I’m such a good mood, I’m actually
   finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and
   charming today.

   Penny: Mmm, what smells so good?

   Sheldon: That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a
   perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening
   holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali
   loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would
   reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally,
   it’s main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer’s cheese which would
   cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.

   Penny: Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.

   Sheldon: Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so
   if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please
   do not disturb me.

   Penny: Have fun, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh, I shall. (Sings Superman theme while searching his
   pockets.) No!

   Penny: What’s wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice
   thingy?

   Scene: A Vegas bathroom.

   Raj: Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and
   conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.

   Leonard: Howard, could I borrow some after shave?

   Howard: Black case, top compartment.

   Leonard: That is a lot of cologne.

   Howard: First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and
   botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.

   Raj (finding a large quantity of condoms): That’s the spirit,
   Howard. Yes, we can.

   Leonard: Come on, let’s go.

   Howard: You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.

   Leonard: That’s not an email, that’s Leslie’s facebook page.

   Howard: Okay, fine, I’m checking her facebook page, look at her
   status update, she’s saying she dumped me, people need to know
   I dumped her.

   Raj: But she did dump you.

   Howard: Grow up, Raj,there’s no place for truth on the
   internet. Just go, I’ll catch up with you.

   Leonard: Alright.

   Raj: Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.

   Leonard: Okay, uh, if I get lucky I’ll take her to my stately
   manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I’ll sleep on
   the moon.

   Raj: Sounds like a plan.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here
   somewhere.

   Sheldon: We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get
   a bowl.

   Penny: So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget
   his key in the first place.

   Sheldon: I left them in the bowl.

   Penny: Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.

   Sheldon: Where?

   Penny: In your apartment.

   Sheldon: What’s it doing in my apartment?

   Penny: Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys
   weren’t home, and I forgot it there.

   Sheldon: You were in my… why would you… what are you saying?

   Penny: It’s not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out
   of milk.

   Sheldon: You’re the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I
   knew that carton felt lighter.

   Penny: Alright, Sheldon, let’s just calm down and we’ll call
   the building manager, he’ll come open your door, you just eat
   your dinner here while you’re waiting.

   Sheldon: Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?

   Penny: Yeah, why not?

   Sheldon: Sure, why not? And after the sun’s down we can all
   pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek.
   ‘Cause today’s the day to stop making sense.

   Scene: A bar at the Las Vegas Casino.

   Leonard (to barmaid): Thanks.

   Raj: I’m telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks
   brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp
   for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest
   place on earth.

   Leonard (as he wins on his slot machine): Dude, check it out.
   That’s laundry for a month!

   Woman (leaning over Raj): Hi.

   Raj (taking a big gulp of his drink): Hello.

   Woman: What’s your name?

   Raj: Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.

   Woman: Hello Rajesh Ram… Hi, Rajesh, I’m Michaela.

   Raj: Hello, Michaela.

   Michaela: So, are you interested a little party?

   Raj: Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it
   would be, if it weren’t Ramayan.

   Leonard: Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.

   Raj: Not now, Leonard, Michaela’s inviting me to a party. You
   better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for
   you.

   Leonard: Yeah, I really need to talk to you.

   Raj: Excuse me, I’ll be right back. Don’t go anywhere. Don’t
   move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that
   you are. (To Leonard) What’s wrong with you dude, that woman
   was all up in my jammy.

   Leonard: Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your
   jammy is, but, I’m pretty sure she is a prostitute.

   Raj: What? No. ..

   Leonard: Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how
   many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and
   asked if you wanted to party.

   Raj: Maybe I can save her.

   Leonard: Maybe, but I’m guessing it will cost you about $500 an
   hour to try.

   Raj: It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future
   endeavours.

   Michaela: Whatever.

   Raj: Oh, I miss her already.

   Leonard: Oh, Howard’s losing it. Check out his latest twitters.
   “I’m at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My
   life is meaningless, my future is without hope.”

   Raj: Why don’t we take him to see the Blue Man Group?

   Leonard: You think that’d help?

   Raj: USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.

   Leonard: I don’t know, Howard isn’t really the family fun kind
   of guy.

   Raj: It’s too bad he wasn’t here for that hooker. She’s exactly
   his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would
   cheer him up.

   Leonard: We’re not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.

   Raj (reading Howard’s twitter): “I’m so lonely and horny I may
   open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.”

   Leonard: Suppose it wouldn’t hurt to get an estimate.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: So, how was your day?

   Penny: Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you
   really don’t have to.

   Sheldon: No, it’s the accepted convention. How was your day?

   Penny: Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the
   restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different…

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, that’s not going to interest me at all,
   just eat.

   Scene: The casino bar.

   Raj: Hello again.

   Michaela: Oh, hi.

   Leonard: Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you’re not busy, well, w-we
   were thinking you could… well, we were wondering…

   Raj: If you’re really a prostitute.

   Michaela: You guys cops?

   Together: No.

   Michaela: I am a prostitute.

   Leonard: Okay, great. Um… uh, the thing is, we’ve got this
   friend, and he’s kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that
   maybe you could cheer him up.

   Raj: With sex.

   Leonard: I think she knows what I meant.

   Raj: How can she when you beat around the bush. She’s from the
   mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.

   Michaela: Don’t worry, I can take good care of your friend.

   Leonard: Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we
   can do this where he doesn’t know that you’re a… you know…

   Raj: Prostitute.

   Michaela: You want the girlfriend experience.

   Leonard: Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.

   Raj: Uh, actually, if it’s not too much to ask, could we have
   the Jewish girlfriend experience.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: Okay, that’s question 20, you have to guess.

   Penny: Oh, God, I don’t know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?

   Sheldon: How can one person be a whole movie?

   Penny: Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?

   Sheldon: Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with
   benefits.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?

   Penny: Where did that even come from, did he say we were?

   Sheldon: No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on
   over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.

   Penny: No, just mail, no benefits.

   Sheldon: Hmm, I see.

   Penny: Why are you asking?

   Sheldon: I’m curious about the whole social construct. On its
   face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one
   is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that
   seems eminently practical. What I’ve observed, however, is
   Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.

   Penny: Well, some people just can’t handle that kind of
   relationship.

   Sheldon: Can you?

   Penny: Excuse me?

   Sheldon: Are you able to have sex with men without developing
   an emotional attachment?

   Penny: Sheldon, I really don’t want to talk about this with
   you.

   Sheldon: Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?

   Penny: Of course it’s making me uncomfortable, can’t you tell?

   Sheldon: I really have no idea. I don’t particularly excel at
   reading facial expressions, body language…

   Penny: I’m uncomfortable, Sheldon!

   Sheldon: Thank you, that’s very helpful.

   Scene: The casino bar.

   Howard: Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?

   Leonard: Behold?

   Howard: Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby’s arm?

   Raj: A little baby.

   Howard: I’m going back to the room.

   Michaela (arriving): Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a
   nice brisket?

   Howard: Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.

   Michaela: Esther Rosenblatt.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: I don’t think the manager’s coming tonight so, here.

   Sheldon: Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.

   Penny: Well, it wasn’t the first suggestion that came to mind,
   but it’s the one I’m going with.

   Sheldon: I can’t sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And
   given it’s dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M.
   Snickering’s beloved children’s book , The Tall Man From
   Cornwall.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length
   exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it,
   there’s no room for my big Cornish head.

   Penny: Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition.
   That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.

   Sheldon: May I say one last thing.

   Penny: Only if it doesn’t rhyme.

   Sheldon: Alright. Goodnight.

   Scene: The casino bar.

   Michaela: Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of
   the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the
   Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.

   Howard: Really, me too.

   Michaela: Oy gevalt, you’re hot.

   Howard: Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.

   Leonard: Hey, how’s it going.

   Howard: Cut the crap, you set this up, didn’t you?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Howard: She’s a hooker, isn’t she.

   Raj: A prostitute, yes.

   Howard: You already gave her the money?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Howard: Thank you!

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: Penny.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: I can’t sleep. how are you going?

   Penny: Maybe that’s because your hole is still open.

   Sheldon: I’m homesick.

   Penny: Your home is twenty feet from here.

   Sheldon: Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn’t matter.
   It’s in a galaxy far, far away.

   Penny: Damn it. What do you want me to do

   Sheldon: Sing soft kitty.

   Penny: That’s only for when you’re sick.

   Sheldon: Homesick is a type of being sick.

   Penny: Come on, do I really have to?

   Sheldon: I suppose we can stay up and talk.

   Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty,
   um…

   Sheldon: Sleepy kitty.

   Penny: Sleepy ki…

   Sheldon: No. Start over.

   Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty,
   sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.

   Sheldon: Penny.

   Penny: Yeah.

   Sheldon: Thank you for letting me stay here.

   Penny: Oh, you’re welcome sweetie.

   Sheldon: Okay, I’m sleepy now, get out.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: Oh, good, you’re finally home.

   Leonard: What were you doing at Penny’s?

   Sheldon: Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I
   spent the night. Oh, you’ll be happy to know that I now have a
   much better understanding of friends with benefits.
