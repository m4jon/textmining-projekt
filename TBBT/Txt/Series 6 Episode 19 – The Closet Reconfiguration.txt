Series 6 Episode 19 – The Closet Reconfiguration

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: What you doing?

   Howard: You said clean up. I’m cleaning up.

   Bernadette: You can’t just throw everything in the closet.

   Howard: Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how
   to do it, but you can’t do both. This isn’t sex.

   Bernadette: What if someone looks in there?

   Howard: They’re just coming over for dinner. No one’s gonna
   look in the closet.

   Bernadette: Well, you don’t know that. What if someone’s
   looking for the bathroom and they open that door?

   Howard: Could work out. For all we know there’s a toilet in
   there somewhere.

   Bernadette: Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on
   this mess.

   Howard: You know what we should do? We should show the closet
   to Sheldon.

   Bernadette: Why?

   Howard: Are you kidding? He’s like a savant at organizing.
   Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his
   label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if
   you look really close at that label maker label, you’ll see a
   label that says label.

   Bernadette: He’s our guest, we can’t just ask him to straighten
   our closet.

   Howard: No, we wouldn’t ask him. We’d just show him the closet
   and let the goblins in his head take it from there.

   Later.

   Howard: Hey, guys, come on in.

   All: Hi.

   Penny: Ooh, it smells good.

   Bernadette: Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight’s the night
   you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the
   ingredients and made it from scratch.

   Sheldon: Oh, you shouldn’t have.

   Bernadette: Oh, it’s my pleasure.

   Sheldon: No, you really shouldn’t have. I brought my own.

   Bernadette: You stopped and got him takeout?

   Leonard: I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.

   Bernadette: Sheldon, I’ve been cooking all day.

   Sheldon: Well, now don’t you feel silly.

   Bernadette: Show him the closet.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Raj: These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.

   Bernadette: That’s the takeout that Sheldon brought.

   Raj: Oh, well, I’m sure they wouldn’t have tasted nearly as
   good if I hadn’t tried your food first.

   Sheldon: Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally
   or by colour?

   Howard: Colour’s fine.

   Sheldon: Wrong, they’ll be arranged seasonally.

   Penny: Sheldon, aren’t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?

   Amy: Oh, it’s okay, I’m used to it. The other day at Whole
   Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.

   Sheldon: Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager
   chased me out with an artisanal salami.

   Amy: His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please
   agree with me.

   Scene: The closet.

   Leonard: Sheldon, come on. It’s getting late. Time to go.

   Sheldon: Oh, five more minutes.

   Leonard: That’s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny
   are already in the car. Let’s move it.

   Sheldon: How come I never get to do anything I want to do?

   Howard: You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can
   give him a ride home.

   Sheldon: Please, Leonard, he said it’s okay.

   Leonard: Sheldon, it’s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.

   Sheldon: Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling
   pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?

   Howard: Juggle.

   Sheldon: You health nuts kill me.

   Bernadette: Oh, my God, it’s beautiful. Look, he found the
   juggling pins I hid.

   Sheldon: Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this
   letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it
   could either be filed…

   Howard: Whoa, you opened this?

   Sheldon: Well, I had to find out if it was personal
   correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on
   the content…

   Howard: I couldn’t be less interested. Now, come on, I’ll take
   you home.

   Bernadette: Howard, don’t you want to know what’s in the
   letter?

   Howard: If I wanted to know, I would’ve opened it years ago.
   The closet looks great. Let’s get out of here.

   Sheldon: Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to
   sort on the ride?

   Howard: Do whatever you want.

   Sheldon: Thanks. Oh. Great party.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Leonard: You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his
   scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.

   Penny: What is your point?

   Leonard: Well, it’s just kind of weird how grown up he is now.
   Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.

   Penny: Really? You couldn’t just say that? You had to tell the
   scrotum story?

   Leonard: Trying to paint a picture.

   Penny: It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a
   coffee table.

   Leonard: Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too.
   Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.

   Penny: Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice
   clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?

   Leonard: Yeah. Although…

   Penny: No.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: Howie, you okay?

   Howard: Yeah, I just couldn’t sleep.

   Bernadette: Told you you shouldn’t have espresso after dinner.
   I know the little cups make you feel big, but it’s not worth
   it.

   Howard: It’s this stupid letter.

   Bernadette: Did you read it?

   Howard: No.

   Bernadette: You must be curious.

   Howard: Of course I’m curious. I haven’t seen the man since,
   oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th
   birthday? What’s that about?

   Bernadette: Why don’t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or
   explains why he left.

   Howard: He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a
   chance to explain anything?

   Bernadette: I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?

   Howard: Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets
   fire to it)

   Bernadette: Really? Are you sure?

   Howard: Yep.

   Bernadette: Feel better?

   Howard: I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us
   is tall enough to reach that.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy: I can’t believe he set it on fire.

   Bernadette: Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him
   out. And he was already having a tough day ’cause he
   accidentally wore my pants to work. I don’t know why he was
   upset. They were bigger on him than me.

   Amy: Boy, I’m really curious what was in that letter.

   Bernadette: Me, too, but I guess now we’ll never know.

   Amy: Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?

   Bernadette: I can’t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I
   didn’t respect my husband’s privacy?

   Penny: What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the
   room?

   Bermadette: That works.

   Penny: Okay.

   Scene: The laundry room.

   Sheldon: Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building’s belly
   button.

   Penny: Hey, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?

   Amy: You have something we want.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to
   pretty boys in the big city.

   Penny: No, we just want information.

   Sheldon: Oh. Oh, I’ve got that in spades. Ravage me.

   Penny: We heard you read the letter from Howard’s father.

   Sheldon: I did.

   Penny: What did it say?

   Sheldon: I can’t tell you that. I’m bound by closet
   organizer/organizee confidentiality.

   Amy: Sheldon, that’s not a real thing.

   Sheldon: Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your
   girlfriend’s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn’t stop
   you from pawing at me like you’re a bear and I’m a trash can
   full of sweets.

   Penny: Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.

   Sheldon: Control over the information contained in that letter
   belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That
   doesn’t give me the right to disseminate it freely.

   Penny: Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette’s
   closet. Doesn’t that count for something?

   Sheldon: Are you pointing out that California is a community
   property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married,
   the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly
   owned by the two spouses?

   Penny: Yeah, obviously.

   Sheldon: Well played. Sometimes I don’t give you enough credit,
   Penny.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with
   this party.

   Leonard: Actually, all I did was invite you.

   Raj: Well, put your mind at ease. I’m here to make sure your
   dinner party kicks Howard’s dinner party’s ass. Now, the first
   thing we need is a theme. I’m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century
   Moulin Rouge.

   Leonard: I’m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and
   I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light
   jazz music, hors d’oeuvres.

   Raj: So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some
   crab puffs from Trader Joe’s? Hate to miss that.

   Leonard: Hey, where have you been?

   Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I’d say I was
   pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.

   Leonard: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
   ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you’ve been gone a long time.

   Sheldon: Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and
   Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about
   Howard’s father.

   Leonard: What information?

   Sheldon: I can’t tell you that. I am bound by closet
   organizer/organizee confidentiality.

   Raj: Well, come on, we won’t tell anyone.

   Sheldon: Sorry, badgering me won’t work. What you should have
   said is, It’s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny
   will tell us.

   Leonard: Fine, then that.

   Sheldon: All right, I’ll tell you. My goodness, everyone’s on
   their game today.

   Scene: The apartment kitchen.

   Amy: This is really fun.

   Raj: Yeah, it’s nice to get dressed up once in a while.

   Penny: Yeah, and the hors d’oeuvres are delightful.

   Leonard: As is the company.

   Penny: Aw.

   Sheldon: My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.

   Leonard: Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here,
   et’s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.

   Raj: Of course.

   Penny: Sure.

   Amy: Absolutely.

   Sheldon: If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Howard: Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these
   flights of stairs.

   Bernadette: Yeah, try doing it in heels.

   Howard: I am.

   Bernadette: Wait. There’s something I have to tell you.

   Howard: What?

   Bernadette: I know what was in your dad’s letter.

   Howard: Sheldon, I swear to God, I’m gonna kill you.

   Amy: Hey.

   Bernadette: I made him tell us.

   Howard: What? Us? Who else knows?

   Penny: I know.

   Amy: Me, too.

   Leonard: Same here.

   Raj: Shame on all of you.

   Leonard: You know, too.

   Raj: Couldn’t leave him one friend, could you?

   Howard: So everybody knows what’s in that letter except for me?

   Sheldon: Yes, it’s six against one. Stand down, sir.

   Howard: How could you do this?

   Bernadette: I’m sorry.

   Raj: If you want, we could tell you.

   Howard: No, I don’t want to know. I mean, I do, but… I got to
   go.

   Amy: Use me as a human shield!

   Sheldon: I panicked. He looked taller than usual.

   Scene: The closet.

   Bernadette (off): Howard?

   Howard: In here.

   Bernadette: I’m sorry. I should have left it alone.

   Howard: It’s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.

   Bernadette: What are you looking at?

   Howard: Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.

   Bernadette: That’s nice.

   Howard: I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for
   blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look
   at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever.
   Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was
   happy to see me with those.

   Bernadette: Think you could take a break?

   Howard: Why?

   Bernadette: Got a little surprise for you. Come on.

   Howard: Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I’ll
   lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but… Oh. What are
   you guys doing here?

   Leonard: When you left, you weren’t sure whether or not you
   wanted to know what was in your dad’s letter, so we came up
   with kind of a cool solution.

   Howard: Oh, yeah, what’s that?

   Sheldon: It’s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing
   and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic
   example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a
   physical system exists partially in all its possible states at
   once.

   Penny: We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the
   elephant in the room, so…

   Sheldon: Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you
   with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of
   which is true, and then we don’t tell you which one it is, you
   will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.

   Penny: Yeah. And I said if it wasn’t epistemic, we might as
   well not do it.

   Bernadette: Sit down, honey.

   Leonard: Raj, you’re up.

   Raj: Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it
   said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a
   Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to
   the underside of an airplane. Thinks it’s a fly. Silly frog. So
   funny.

   Leonard: Sheldon.

   Sheldon: It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous
   pirate One-Eyed Willy.

   Howard: Nice try. That’s the plot for Goonies.

   Amy: Told you.

   Sheldon: Don’t.

   Leonard: Amy.

   Amy: You didn’t know it, but your father was in the auditorium
   at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so
   proud of you.

   Howard: Really?

   Sheldon: Or that’s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It
   still could be the map.

   Leonard: Penny.

   Penny: It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn’t who he
   said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and
   the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.

   Sheldon: I would like to change mine. The pirate’s name was
   Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it’s completely different from Goonies.

   Amy: No, it’s not.

   Sheldon: Don’t.

   Leonard: Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the
   most important thing, and that you should never throw it away
   like he did.

   Howard: Hmm.

   Leonard: Bernadette.

   Bernadette: Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad
   holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard,
   my son, my greatest gift. You okay?

   Howard: Yeah. I’m terrific.

   Leonard: So, which one do you think it is, matey?

   Howard: Actually, I don’t want to know. I want all of them to
   be true.

   Leonard: Well, one of them is.

   Howard: That’s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.

   Penny: Hey, it’s still early. Why don’t we go back and have
   that party?

   Raj: Yeah,

   Leonard: Yeah, cool.

   Amy: Okay.

   Sheldon: You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your
   father wasn’t the most interesting thing I read in the closet.
   Bernadette’s diary has some saucy passages.

   Bernadette: Sheldon, don’t you dare.

   Sheldon: There’s nothing to worry about. Your secret’s safe
   with me.

   Bernadette: That’s more like it.

   Sheldon: Although copyright law would allow me to quote
   snippets in the context of a review.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Bernadette: Glad you’re feeling better.

   Howard: Me, too. If I’d known we were gonna be dancing, would
   have worn my flats.

   Penny: This turned out pretty well, huh?

   Leonard: Yeah, I think so.

   Raj: I agree. That is, if you’ve never been to or heard of a
   party before.

   Amy: If you’d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the
   right place, you’d be happy all the time.

   Sheldon: Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your
   closet. Is there any reason you’re keeping this dead goldfish?

   Penny: Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.

   Sheldon: Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found
   what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.

   Penny: Party’s over! Party’s over!
