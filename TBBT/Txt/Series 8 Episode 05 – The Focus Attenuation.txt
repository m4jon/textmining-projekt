Series 8 Episode 05 – The Focus Attenuation

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Raj: Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your
   footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your
   cell phone while walking.

   Leonard: We had that idea years ago. How come we never did
   anything with it?

   Howard: Probably because we left the diagram of it in the
   restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.

   Sheldon: I know the real reason you never made progress with
   that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days
   later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your
   genitals, your brain became a ghost town.

   Leonard: That’s not what happened.

   Sheldon: I remember it distinctly because I had just composed
   my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss’s
   death.

   Howard: No one wants to hear it.

   Sheldon: Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was
   old.

   Leonard: Penny is not the reason I didn’t pursue that idea.

   Sheldon: Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your
   greatest accomplishments?

   Raj: Easy. Sleeping with Penny.

   Howard: Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped
   him.

   Raj: Tricking Penny into getting engaged.

   Howard: And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.

   Leonard: I think someone owes me an apology.

   Sheldon: Well, don’t feel bad. I think we’ve all been
   distracted since the girls entered our lives.

   Howard: You admit Amy’s a distraction?

   Sheldon: Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two
   days ago. Hi. Hope you’re having a good day. Who has time for
   this constant sexting?

   Leonard: Well, maybe we have lost our focus.

   Howard: It wouldn’t kill us to get together and brainstorm
   ideas.

   Raj: Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.

   LeonardLike our own science retreat.

   Howard: My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.

   Sheldon: I’m not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the
   movie Cabin in the Woods?

   Leonard: Then we’ll go to a hotel.

   Sheldon: A hotel? Did you see The Shining?

   Raj: We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.

   Sheldon: Did you see The Lake House?

   Raj: Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling
   mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my
   life down the toilet.

   Leonard: Fine. Then we’ll just stay here and do it.

   Sheldon: Well, you didn’t suggest a beach house.

   Leonard: You would go to a beach house?

   Sheldon: Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Hey.

   Leonard: Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind
   of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if
   that’s okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on
   Sunday.

   Penny: Want to go to Vegas this weekend?

   Amy: Of course I do.

   Penny: Bernadette? Girl’s weekend. Vegas. You in?

   Bernadette: Hell, yeah.

   Penny: Yes. I’ll check flights.

   Bernadette: I’ll check hotels.

   Amy: I’ll check my underpants. I’m so excited, I think I peed.

   Leonard: They seem okay with it.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Hey.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Howard: Hey. I didn’t think you’d make it.

   Raj: Why not?

   Howard: Well, ’cause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we
   assumed you’d have to stay home to lower the food down to her
   in the pit.

   Raj: For your information, Emily is working tonight.

   Sheldon: Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.

   Leonard: Okay, let’s focus. The girls are gone, we have 48
   hours. There are no distractions. Let’s change the world.

   Sheldon: Thinking caps on.

   Howard: Here we go.

   Raj: Ooh, this is exciting. We’re innovating. I feel like we’re
   in the Facebook movie.

   Howard: Oh. I never saw that.

   Sheldon: Really?

   Raj: Oh. It’s wonderful, and I swear I’m not saying that
   because Justin Timberlake is in it.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.

   Raj: Cool. I’ll make the popcorn.

   Leonard: Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let’s change the
   world to let’s watch TV.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. Is that a no?

   Howard: Okay. No. Leonard’s right. We’re here to focus. Didn’t
   we used to have a list of all our ideas?

   Leonard: I, I think I still have it.

   Sheldon: I did not get a clear answer. I’m gonna set this down
   now.

   Leonard: Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven’t looked at these in
   years. Robot girlfriend.

   Howard: Mm, that was mine.

   Leonard: Robot prostitute.

   Howard: Also mine.

   Sheldon: Wait. I’m confused. Why would you need both a robot
   girlfriend and a robot prostitute?

   Howard: There’s just some things you don’t do with your robot
   girlfriend.

   Raj: Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really
   took a hit.

   Leonard: Okay, let’s just skip all the inventions you can have
   sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat
   cushion.

   Howard: No, it vibrates. Keep going.

   Leonard: You know, let’s just come up with something new.

   Sheldon: You know, a number of significant innovations have
   been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous
   satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that
   came from Star Trek. And I’ve long suspected that the idea of
   an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep
   Impact.

   Raj: Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only
   a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven’t been
   invented yet.

   Leonard: How cool would that be if we could make one of those a
   reality?

   Sheldon: If we could figure out the scientific basis for
   Marty’s hover board, that would have universal application.

   Leonard: Well, it’s, it’s possible at absolute zero, but we
   would have to remove the temperature restrictions.

   Raj: Oh, I have an idea.

   Sheldon: I think I have the same one.

   Howard: We got to watch Back to the Future II.

   Raj: I’ll make the popcorn.

   Scene: A Vegas hotel room.

   Penny: So, where should we go first?

   Amy: Ooh. There’s a cover band in the lounge.

   Penny: Nah.

   Amy: But they play Barry Manilow.

   Penny: No.

   Amy: But they’re called Fairly Manilow.

   Penny: Oh. Okay.

   Amy: Great.

   Penny: No.

   Bernadette: Well, what do you want to do?

   Penny: Well, we’re in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a
   bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette
   wheel and watch it go everywhere.

   Amy: What if we don’t want to vomit?

   Penny: Oh, you will. That’s why they give you the bucket.
   Uh-oh.

   Amy: What?

   Penny: It’s my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.

   Amy: What does that mean?

   Penny: It means instead of having a week to study, I only have
   two days.

   Bernadette: That sucks.

   Amy: Can you start in the morning?

   Penny: Uh, it’s kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little
   tonight, and I’ll catch up with you guys later.

   Bernadette: You sure?

   Penny: Yeah, it’s okay. Go ahead.

   Amy: So, um, now that Penny’s not coming…

   Bernadette: We’re not seeing Fairly Manilow.

   Amy: Okay.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: Hold on. Pause. Something doesn’t make sense. Look, in
   2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine
   back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he
   does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to
   would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were
   in.

   Leoanard: This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If
   future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff
   the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc
   in it. Because it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff
   placed his first bet.

   Sheldon: Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?

   Leonard: What do you mean?

   Sheldon: Is placed the right tense for something that would
   have happened in the future of a past that was affected by
   something from the future?

   Leonard: Had will have placed?

   Sheldon: That’s my boy.

   Leonard: Okay, so, it wasn’t until his 21st birthday that Biff
   had will have placed his first bet and made his millions.
   That’s when he altered the timeline.

   Sheldon: Yeah, but he had will haven’t placed it!

   Howard: What?

   Sheldon: Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn’t be more
   simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate
   future he creates isn’t the one in which Marty and Doc Brown
   ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the
   new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine…

   Leonard: Wait. Is brought right?

   Sheldon: Marty and Doc never had have had brought?

   Leonard: I don’t know. You did it to me.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m going with it. Marty and Doc never had have
   had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff
   could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff.
   Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is
   also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac.
   And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn’t, never had
   have hasn’t.

   Raj: He’s right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like
   when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.

   Howard: Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail
   weenies.

   Leonard: Guys.

   Sheldon: Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German
   name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?

   Raj: Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually
   looks like a wiener?

   Leonard: Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we
   could focus.

   Sheldon: I don’t think it worked.

   Scene: A bar in Vegas.

   Amy: Maybe after this, you’ll be in the mood for some Manilow.

   Bernadette: I think after this, I’ll be dead.

   Amy: Look at us out, while Penny’s in the room studying.

   Bernadette: I’m proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It’s
   nice to see her take it seriously.

   Amy: It is. But enough about Penny. Let’s talk about us. We’re
   looking good.

   Bernadette: We are.

   Amy: Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body’s
   bangin’.

   Bernadette: Amy.

   Amy: Don’t Amy me. We’re always talking about how hot Penny is.
   Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron
   Colliders?

   Bernadette: You’re embarrassing me.

   Amy: Oh, don’t be embarrassed. I’ll show you the divot in my
   spine.

   Bernadette: What?

   Amy: No, no, it’s okay. I was born with it. If you put a
   double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.

   Scene: Leonard’s laboratory.

   Leonard: All right.

   Sheldon: Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer
   distractions in here.

   Raj: Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on
   work.

   Leonard: So, I’ve been thinking about the hover boards, and
   maybe there’s a way we could use Maglev technology.

   Howard: Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the
   materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.

   Sheldon: Well, I wonder if anyone’s tried that.

   Raj: Go online and look it up.

   Shortly afterwards.

   Howard: Oh, I can’t argue with him. It’s right there on the
   screen. Austria does look like a wiener.

   Raj: That’s nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.

   Leonard: I’m sure Mrs. Florida’s walking funny. Can we get back
   to work?

   Sheldon: Yeah, he’s right. Oh, here’s a thought. What if we use
   some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from
   getting off topic?

   Howard: Like behavior modification?

   Sheldon: Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used
   to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?

   Raj: That cannot be true.

   Shortly afterwards.

   Raj: Hey, it was match point.

   Leonard: Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with
   punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying
   off topic.

   Raj: Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to
   mind.

   Howard: We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we
   get sidetracked.

   Sheldon: Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle
   chatter was punished with a device called the scold’s bridle.
   It’s an iron cage that’s locked around the head and pierces the
   tongue.

   Leonard: If only we had one.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’ll check Amazon.

   Scene: The hotel room.

   Bernadette: Housekeeping.

   Amy: We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in
   there.

   Bernadette: It was us the whole time.

   Amy: Why’d you tell her? It was working.

   Bernadette: Was it working?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Bernadette: Oh, I’m so sorry.

   Penny: You guys look like you’re having fun.

   Amy: We’re having the best time.

   Bernadette: Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.

   Penny: That’s a dollar.

   Bernadette: Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail
   waitress.

   Amy: Hey, Penny, hey, let’s go. We found a place that has
   Australian male strippers.

   Bernadette: We want to see if they twirl their junk in the
   other direction.

   Penny: That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying
   to do.

   Amy: Can you believe this nerd?

   Bernadette: Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or
   do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man’s G-string
   like a baby kangaroo?

   Penny: All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I’ve
   got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you
   get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he’s taking off his
   pants, he is not a real policeman.

   Amy: Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let’s
   just, we’ll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here,
   here, I’m gonna quiz you. I’m gonna quiz you. I got your notes.
   I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they’re
   gonna be at the strip club.

   Bernadette: Aren’t you gonna chase her?

   Penny: To the walk-in closet? Sure.

   Scene: Leonard’s lab.

   Leonard: Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic
   they get their arm hair yanked off.

   Raj: And I really can’t let that happen or the girl who does my
   eyebrows will think I’ve been cheating on her.

   Leonard: All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling…

   Sheldon: Wait, a question, who decides if someone’s gone off
   topic?

   Leonard: I think it’ll be pretty clear. If not, we’ll take a
   vote. Oh, and also…

   Sheldon: Ow. We didn’t vote!

   Leonard: We didn’t have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now
   come on. Back to work. If we’re leaning towards quantum
   coupling… Aah! Why?

   Sheldon: You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the
   show Quantum Leap. That’s a tangent and it’s your fault.

   Howard: That’s ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a
   tangent.

   Leonard: Thank you. And now I owe you one.

   Sheldon: Ow. That was your fault.

   Howard: Hey.

   Raj: Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I’m gonna hear it
   from Jenny.

   Leonard: Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative
   reinforcement isn’t working.

   Sheldon: I think you mean positive punishment. Negative
   reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It’s a
   common mistake.

   Howard: Negative reinforcement is really wrong?

   Sheldon: Oh, it’s used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill
   Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.

   Raj: No way. Not Bill Murray.

   Shortly afterwards.

   Bill Murray (on screen): I’m studying the effect of negative
   reinforcement on ESP ability.

   Raj: Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.

   Howard: Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Leonard’s right. We can’t just jump ahead. We have to
   watch the whole movie.

   Leonard: Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the
   Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that
   look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like
   Denmark.

   Raj: Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.

   Leonard: It’s late. We’ve wasted hours. Can we please find it
   in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?

   Sheldon: But we didn’t see them bust one ghost.

   Leonard: So you’re, you’re saying we should stand here in my
   lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a
   crappy laptop?

   Sheldon: No.

   Scene: The apartment.

   All: Ghostbusters!

   Leonard: It really does hold up.

   Scene: The Vegas strip club.

   Bernadette: See? Isn’t this better than a hotel room?

   Penny: Yep. Shake that thing.

   Bernadette: Have you ever seen a body so fine?

   Amy: We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but
   none of them moved like that.

   Scene: The hotel room.

   Penny: Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you
   said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow,
   it’s bright out. Isn’t it bright? I should probably close these
   curtains. Nah. Bye.

   Bernadette: Would you please close the drapes?

   Amy: Okay.
