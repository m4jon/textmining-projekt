Series 5 Episode 03 – The Pulled Groin Extrapolation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Who wants the last dumpling?

   Penny: Ooh, me.

   Sheldon: Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that
   culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it
   is reserved for the most important and valued member of the
   group.

   Penny: Thank you all for this high honour.

   Sheldon: I’ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.

   Howard: All right, honey, if we’re gonna make the movie, we
   should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but
   when I say honey, I mean my fiancée. (Raj whispers to him)
   Yeah, well, now it means her.

   Bernadette: It’s okay if he wants to come.

   Howard: Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.

   Penny: All right, I got to go to work. I’ll walk down with you.

   Sheldon: Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in
   Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?

   Howard: Neither of them are close.

   Sheldon: Oh, well, then I guess it doesn’t matter which one of
   you drives me. Let’s play a fun guessing game to see who gets
   to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a
   printer’s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.

   Penny: Okay, I’m not driving him.

   Sheldon: No, Penny, don’t give up, you can get this.

   Leonard: Aren’t you going with Sheldon?

   Amy: No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell
   them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.

   Leonard: Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so…

   Amy: I can’t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.

   Leonard: Okay. Wouldn’t you be more comfortable at home?

   Amy: Not really, no.

   Leonard: All righty then. Guess I’ll just get started.

   Amy: Leonard, please. I don’t need the running commentary.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment. Amy is staring into space.

   Leonard: Amy?

   Amy: Yo.

   Leonard: You okay?

   Amy: Oh, sure.

   Leonard: I thought you were reading.

   Amy: I was. Now I’m thinking about what I read. You all right,
   Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.

   Leonard: I, I’m fine.

   Amy: Should I go? I’ve been told sometimes I overstay my
   welcome.

   Leonard: What, who told you that?

   Amy: Well, most recently my gynaecologist.

   Leonard: Well, you stay as long as you’d like.

   Amy: I’m glad to hear you say that, because I’m having a
   wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.

   Scene: Raj’s car.

   Bernadette: What are you going to get at the train store,
   Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m not buying anything. They’re having a lecture.
   H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the
   fun. Very controversial topic.

   Howard: Which side do you come down on?

   Sheldon: I’ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people,
   I’m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we
   all know it’s O-gauge or no gauge.

   Howard: Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy
   trains?

   Bernadette: That’s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full
   of magic tricks at his mother’s house.

   Howard: First of all, they’re not tricks, they’re illusions.
   And, secondly, when we get married, they’re all going up in the
   attic so you can have that closet for clothes.

   Bernadette: Why would I keep clothes at your mother’s house?

   Howard: Well, don’t think of it that way. Once we move in,
   it’ll be our house.

   Bernadette: Is she moving out?

   Howard: Why would she move out? It’s her house.

   Bernadette: Hang on. You seriously think I’m going to live with
   your mother?

   Sheldon: Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette,
   that’s exactly what he thinks.

   Howard: Why not? It’s a great house, plenty of room, and if we
   have kids, Mom’s there to help. You know, when she tells the
   Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her
   chinny-chin-chin.

   Bernadette: I’m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not
   ever.

   Howard: Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.

   Bernadette: Raj, take me home.

   Howard: Don’t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.

   Bernadette: Take me home now.

   Howard: Movie theatre.

   Raj: Mmmmmm.

   Sheldon: Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution
   here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don’t care
   what you people do.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: How was your shower?

   Leonard: It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do
   you usually go to bed?

   Amy: Oh, I’m up all night. I’m like a possum. Boy, you were not
   liked in high school, were you?

   Leonard: Not really. Is that my yearbook?

   Amy: Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you’re really good at science. Maybe
   one day you’ll come up with a cure for being a dork.

   Leonard: Well, it wasn’t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my
   briefcase, I can tell you that.

   Amy: If it makes you feel any better, the only person who
   signed my yearbook was my mother.

   Leonard: Aw.

   Amy: Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends
   and fun. Love, Mom.

   Sheldon (entering): Well, you can add Jerry’s Junction to the
   list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in
   again.

   Leonard: Rough night, Casey Jones?

   Sheldon: You don’t know the half of it. It was billed as a
   lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it
   was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes
   into buying H-O starter sets.

   Leonard: What’s in the bag?

   Sheldon: I don’t want to talk about it. But it’s not a
   spine,I’ll tell you that.

   Amy: Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do
   this again sometime.

   Leonard: Ah, sure. That’d be nice.

   Amy: Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the
   wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They’re
   kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.

   Leonard: Wouldn’t you rather bring Sheldon?

   Amy: I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster.
   He behaved like a child the entire time.

   Sheldon: Not my fault. You said there’d be other scientists
   there my age.

   Amy: Doesn’t matter. You’re out, he’s in. No date to the prom,
   two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.

   Sheldon: Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.

   Scene: Outside Howard’s house. Amy rings the bell.

   Howard (off): I’ll get it!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Could you get it?

   Howard (off): I said I’m getting it!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Fine, I’ll get it!

   Howard: I got it! Oh, hi.

   Bernadette: Hey. I don’t want to fight. I was just surprised
   when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.

   Howard: Yeah, well, I’m sorry I didn’t run it by you first.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don’t know who you’re talking to, but in
   or out! We don’t need bugs!

   Howard: The bugs only come here because you’re their queen!
   Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision
   about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a
   weekend, see what it’s like.

   Bernadette: And your mom would be okay with that?

   Howard: Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays
   here this weekend?

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Hey, if she’s willing to give the milk away
   for free, who am I to say no?

   Howard: See? She’s good with it.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the
   little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set.

   Sheldon: All this years, I’ve been so wrong. The tinier the
   train, the more concentrated the fun.

   Penny: You’re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a
   brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?

   Amy: Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my
   eyes like Cleopatra?

   Penny: Really? For a wedding?

   Amy: Perhaps you’re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis
   already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.

   Leonard: Ready.

   Penny: Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.

   Sheldon: Better than James Bond, because he’s tinier.

   Amy: I got you this to give to me.

   Penny: Oh, sweetie, guests don’t normally wear corsages to a
   wedding. That’s more of a prom thing.

   Amy: I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me,
   but he just used the money to buy drugs.

   Penny: Put the corsage on her.

   Leonard: Amy, this is for you.

   Amy: When you’re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.

   Sheldon: All aboard! Woo-woo! It’s official. I’m an H-O
   trainiac.

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom.

   Howard: So, dinner went nice.

   Bernadette: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut
   your meat for you?

   Howard: Only when it’s fatty. Well, don’t be jealous, babe.
   Someday you’ll get to cut it for me.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette! I found the extra head for the
   Waterpik if you want to use it!

   Bernadette: I’m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): You sure? I just squirted half a brisket
   outta my teeth!

   Howard: Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!

   Bernadette: Oh, God.

   Howard: Relax, it’ll be fine.

   Bernadette: Okay.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Let me know when you’re done canoodling!
   Mommy needs a foot rub!

   Scene: The wedding.

   Amy: Would you like to dance?

   Leonard: No, thank you. I’m really not much of a dancer.

   Amy: You’re not exactly winning any trophies as a
   conversationalist, either.

   Leonard: I’m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.

   Amy: Why shouldn’t they be? They have a feverish night of
   socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures,
   we’d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved
   orgasm.

   Leonard: That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the
   morning, so…

   Amy: Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a
   delight here. And you’re not holding up your end of the
   evening.

   Leonard: Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my
   kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.

   Amy: I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who’s playing with a model
   train right now, you don’t hear me bitching about it. Leonard,
   a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in
   men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.

   Leonard: I’m not moody. I’m fun.

   Amy: You have any evidence to support that statement?

   Leonard: Well, hey, I’m just as much fun as you are.

   Amy: Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger
   as a conversational icebreaker? I am.

   Leonard: Okay, fine, what do you suggest?

   Amy: We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you’re
   sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why
   don’t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat
   through these dress shields.

   Leonard: Once again, I, I’m really not much of a dancer.

   Amy: Don’t worry, I’ll lead. (They do the Birdie Song dance)

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom. Howard is playing with a lightsabre.

   Amy: Howard?

   Howard: Ready for bed?

   Bernadette: No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother’s
   been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.

   Howard: Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her
   business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight’s not your night!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): You don’t know that! I just sat down!

   Howard: Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her
   teeth!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): She can come in and brush her teeth! I’m
   not embarrassed!

   Howard: Problem solved.

   Bernadette: No, it’s not. I’m not going in there.

   Howard: Oh, come on, honey. She’s just sitting in there reading
   a magazine. You can’t see anything. I go in all the time.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Ha! The eagle has landed!

   Howard: And we have splashdown. Wait here, I’m gonna go light a
   candle. And then we make passionate love.

   Scene: The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.

   Amy: There we go, last floor.

   Leonard: I just can’t figure out what happened. I put my left
   leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and
   something just snapped.

   Amy: The hokey pokey is a young man’s game.

   Leonard: I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me
   it’s okay to have fun once in a while.

   Amy: You’re welcome.

   Leonard: And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I
   could hold it against my pulled groin.

   Amy: I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the
   graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.

   Leonard: Well, okay. Again, thank you.

   Amy: And again, you’re welcome.

   Leonard: Want to come in, have a cup of tea?

   Amy: No, thanks. I’m gonna head home.

   Leonard: Okay. Well, good night.

   Amy: Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny’s
   door)

   Penny: Ames, hi. How was the wedding?

   Amy: Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with
   me.

   Penny: Come in, let’s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?

   Amy: Wine is one of the reasons I’m in this fix. That and this
   dang pelvis.

   Penny: Okay, I’m sorry, what exactly happened?

   Amy: The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing
   his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let’s
   face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and
   whore.

   Penny: Oh, God, did he make a move on you?

   Amy: No, but it’s only a matter of time. How could I have not
   seen this coming? Now I’m gonna have to break the little sad
   sack’s heart.

   Penny: Yeah, I’m sure he’ll be okay.

   Amy: Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two
   of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn’t
   get my motor running.

   Penny: So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to
   Leonard, let him down easy?

   Amy: No. I’ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I’ll
   send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be
   his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you’ve got a better shot than
   he does.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive.
   Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.

   Leonard: Sounds like you had a great night.

   Sheldon: I did. How was yours?

   Leonard: Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought
   I would.

   Sheldon: What exactly do you mean by that?

   Leonard: Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy
   loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my
   groin’s a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did
   you do that?

   Sheldon: To send a message. She is not for you.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: Not for you!

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom.

   Bernadette: Good morning, handsome.

   Howard: Morning, Mom.

   Bernadette: It’s me.

   Howard: Yes, it is, and you’re so pretty in the morning.

   Bernadette: Your mom and I made you breakfast.

   Howard: Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?

   Bernadette: Yeah, I guess. We’re very different people, Howard,
   so communication’s a little tricky.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Does he like the pancakes?!

   Bernadette (in a similar voice): He didn’t try them yet!

   Howard: Is there any butter?

   Bernadette: It’s butter-flavoured syrup.

   Howard: Oh.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): So, what’s the word?

   Bernadette: He wants butter!

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): It’s butter-flavoured syrup

   Bernadette: I just told him that!

   Howard: I don’t need any butter.

   Bernadette: If you want butter, I’ll get you butter.

   Howard: Well, I guess I’ll cut these by myself.
