Series 5 Episode 17 – The Rothman Disintegration

   Scene: A corridor at the university

   Raj: It was a nice retirement party.

   Howard: I guess. Still, it’s a shame Professor Rothman was
   forced to step down.

   Leonard: What choice did the university have? He snapped. It
   happens to theoretical physicists all the time.

   Howard: I wonder how long Sheldon’s got.

   Sheldon: These shrimp are all the same size. There’s no the
   logical order to eat them in.

   Leonard: Can’t be very long.

   Raj: Hey, look, there’s Rothman’s empty office. Sad.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Sheldon: Mm, indeed.

   Howard: So sad.

   Sheldon: Dibs.

   Kripke: What’s up, fewwas?

   Sheldon: What are you doing here, Kripke?

   Kripke: Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.

   Sheldon: This is not your office. It hasn’t been assigned yet.

   Kripke: Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when
   Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for
   tots cowwection box.

   Sheldon: Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices
   are not assigned because someone called dibs.

   Leonard: You just called dibs.

   Sheldon: Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived
   at the university first.

   Kripke: I awwived at the office first. I’m the pwoverbial earwy
   bird.

   Rothman (entering, naked): Gentlemen.

   All: Professor Rothman.

   Rothman: Good evening.

   All: Good evening.

   Raj: I’m glad that men are wearing hats again. They’re so
   distinguished.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy: I got you a little something.

   Penny: A little something? Oh, it… what, this is huge.

   Amy: What’s huge is what you’ve done for me.

   Penny: Oh, no, Amy, I haven’t done anything.

   Amy: No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But
   look at me now. I’m like some kind of downtown hipster party
   girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks
   in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.

   Penny: Okay. (Opens parcel to find a huge and not at all
   flattering painting of Penny and Amy)

   Amy: I wanted to get you something you didn’t have.

   Penny: Wow. I-I don’t know what to s… Wow.

   Amy: Do you like it?

   Penny: Do I like it? Wow.

   Amy: So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?

   Penny: Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I’d have to go
   get a hook and nails and a hammer and…

   Amy: No problem.

   Penny: Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right
   there. Wow.

   Scene: A bathroom at the university.

   Sheldon: I found him. He’s in the bathroom. President Siebert?

   Siebert: Can’t this wait?

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. We just need a word.

   Siebert: Now? You realize I’m your boss, and I am holding my
   penis?

   Kripke: Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I’m sowwy. This
   guy’s got no wespect for boundawies.

   Siebert: What do you want?

   Kripke: Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman’s
   office is wightfully mine?

   Siebert: Can’t you take this up with your department chairman?

   Sheldon: We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical.
   Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.

   Siebert: Gentlemen, there’s a task I’m trying to accomplish
   here, and I’m having trouble doing it.

   Sheldon: Oh, my. President Siebert, I don’t mean to be an
   alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a
   symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you’re interested,
   I can send you a link to a YouTube video that’ll show you how
   to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim
   your nails first.

   Kripke: Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I’m sure a young man
   such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.

   Sheldon: Oh, he’s just trying to butter you up. And for the
   record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.

   Siebert: Gentlemen, I’m going to allow the two of you to work
   this out because A, you’re both brilliant scientists, and B, as
   far as who gets Rothman’s office, I couldn’t give the furry
   crack of a rat’s behind.

   Kripke: Well, as wong as we’re here, I might as well take a
   weak.

   Sheldon: Kripke?

   Kripke: Yes?

   Sheldon: You’re in my spot.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Bernadette: That is big.

   Penny: So big.

   Bernadette: And ugly.

   Penny: So ugly. What am I gonna do?

   Bernadette: I don’t know. You can’t take it down. You’ll break
   her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy
   face.

   Penny: Is there any chance I’ll learn to love it?

   Bernadette: That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself
   where you look like a man?

   Penny: All right, it’s got to go.

   Bernadette: What will you tell Amy?

   Penny: How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous
   because you’re not in it?

   Bernadette: Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a
   picture of me and Howard’s mom getting our hair cornrowed in
   Venice Beach. I’ve suffered enough.

   Penny: Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when
   she comes over, but it’s kind of heavy.

   Bernadette: Mmm, too bad you’re not as strong as the dude in
   the painting.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some
   kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a
   stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.

   Howard: It’s numbered.

   Raj: Ooh, limited edition. Nice.

   Sheldon (knock on door): Oh, that’ll be Kripke.

   Leonard: What’s he doing here?

   Sheldon: We’re going to work this office situation out like
   gentlemen. And if that doesn’t work, I’m going to poison his
   tea.

   Kripke: Cooper.

   Sheldon: Kripke. Come in. I’m making tea. Would you like a cup?

   Kripke: Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don’t want tea.
   Wet’s get down to bwass tacks.

   Sheldon: Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship…

   Kripke: We’re not fwiends.

   Sheldon: Well, that’s a little hard to hear, but all right. As
   you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in
   mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman’s office,
   and you will find a way to be okay with that.

   Kripke: How about I take Wothman’s office, and you go suck a
   wemon?

   Sheldon: You sure I can’t get you that cup of tea?

   Raj: How about you decide this with
   Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?

   Kripke: What the fwig is that?

   Sheldon: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by
   Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game
   Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.

   All: Hail.

   Kripke: How does it work?

   Sheldon: Oh, it’s very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper
   covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock
   smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats
   paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it
   always has, rock crushes scissors.

   Kripke: I’m sowwy. Can you wepeat that?

   Sheldon: Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers
   rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes
   scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper
   disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has,
   rock crushes scissors.

   Kripke: Almost got it. One more time.

   Sheldon: Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock…

   Howard: Sheldon, stop. He’s screwing with you.

   Sheldon: Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an
   impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel.
   I’d smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my
   winter things.

   Howard: It’s the 21st century. You can’t have a duel.

   Leonard: H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are
   you?

   Sheldon: Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may
   choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next
   Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star
   Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains.

   Kripke: You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an
   eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven’t watched Star Twek since I
   discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.

   Leonard: It’s gonna be hard to find something you’re both
   equally good at.

   Raj: Is there anything you’re both equally bad at?

   Both: Sports.

   Scene: A basketball court.

   Leonard: All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five
   wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Five what?

   Leonard: Balls in the basket. (Throws ball to Sheldon)

   Sheldon (dodging out of the way): Ew!

   Later. Sheldon dribbling ball, approached Kripke, throws it
   wildly at a pile of mats in the corner.

   Kripke: It’s out, wight?

   Later. Kripke, dribbling ball, watched by Sheldon, dribbles it
   all the way into the back wall.

   Kripke: Time. Wan out of woom.

   Leonard: You know all those terrible things bullies used to do
   to us?

   Raj: Yeah.

   Leonard: I get it.

   Later. Kripke chases ball across room chased by Sheldon. Sounds
   of collision. Sheldon chases ball back across the room chased
   by Kripke.

   Later. Ball hits Sheldon in back of head.

   Sheldon: Hey! He did that on purpose,

   Leonard: No, he didn’t. Nothing that’s happening here is being
   done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let’s try a free
   throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.

   Kripke: Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.

   Leonard: No. No, I’m not.

   Sheldon: Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. (Throws ball.
   It goes about two feet in front of him.) I’m gonna need more
   force.

   Kripke: Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken.
   (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn’t come down.) Do
   I get points for that?

   Later. A trampoline has been added. Sheldon tries first, ball
   hits backboard, bounces back in his face. Kripke tries next,
   with a run up, ends up crashing into the back wall again.

   Later.

   Leonard: All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It’s no longer
   funny. Let’s try something else.

   Sheldon: What do you propose?

   Leonard: Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the
   balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.

   Kripke: Oh, you are going down, Cooper.

   Sheldon: I don’t think so, Kripke. I’ve bounced many a rubber
   ball in my day.

   Leonard: All right, that’s enough trash talk. One, two, three.

   Howard: Sheldon was higher.

   Leonard: Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.

   Sheldon: Who’s unsatisfactory in P.E. now?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy: Oh, what a great movie.

   Penny: I cannot believe you’ve never seen Grease.

   Amy: My mother didn’t allow me to watch it. She was afraid it
   might encourage me to join a gang.

   Bernadette: I’ve got to go. I’ve got to get up early. My
   company’s testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn’t shrink
   testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.

   Amy: I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting
   Penny. Good night, real Penny.

   Penny: Good night, real Amy.

   Amy: You don’t have to say good night to painting Amy, ’cause
   she’s never leaving.

   Bernadette: Good night, real Penny.

   Penny: Bye.

   Bernadette: Good night, transvestite Penny.

   Penny: Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight,
   out of mind. I wish.

   Amy (entering): You know, can I borrow that movie? Those
   singing hooligans really got my motor running.

   Penny: Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you
   can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It’s just going
   to be my gift to you. Bye.

   Amy: Thank you. Wait. Where’d the painting go?

   Penny: It’s right over there.

   Amy: Why?

   Penny: I have no idea. That is weird.

   Amy: You hate it.

   Penny: No. No, no. It’s just, it’s a little big.

   Amy: I feel like an idiot.

   Penny: No, come on, you’re not an idiot. Look, just help me put
   it back up.

   Amy: Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don’t
   need your pity.

   Penny: Oh, Amy, come on.

   Amy: I’m just glad I didn’t go for the sculpture.

   Scene: Rothman’s office.

   Sheldon: Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.

   Raj: I’m happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I’m going
   to miss sharing an office with you.

   Sheldon: Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.

   Raj: Thank you.

   Sheldon: Yeah. Call first. (Pushes him out. Closes door.
   Rothman is standing naked behind it.)

   Rothman: Oh. Hello.

   Sheldon: Professor Rothman. This isn’t your office any more.
   You’re retired.

   Rothman: I think the word you’re looking for is invisible.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Penny: I came to say I’m sorry.

   Amy: Don’t bother.

   Penny: Oh, Amy, please.

   Amy: I’m so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were
   watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.

   Penny: I know.

   Amy: I was a fool from Summer Lovin’ to the very last rama lama
   lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.

   Penny: You’re right. You’re absolutely right. I should have
   been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.

   Amy: Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally
   asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.

   Penny: I don’t think you can put a number on how much one
   person likes another.

   Amy: I bought you a painting that’s 12 square feet in area.
   There’s a number.

   Penny: Amy, come on…

   Amy: If you don’t like feet, you can try dollars. The painting
   set me back three grand.

   Penny: Three gr… Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to
   know is, you are my friend and I don’t want to lose you out of
   my life.

   Amy: I’m sorry, I’m just having trouble believing you right
   now.

   Penny: Grab your hammer.

   Amy: No. Damage is done.

   Penny: Okay, look, I didn’t want to say this, but the real
   reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette
   very jealous.

   Amy: Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The
   painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is
   the least cool.

   Penny: Yeah, th-th-th-that’s what it is, so…

   Amy: You have such a good heart.

   Penny: Huh, I try.

   Amy: Come on.

   Penny: Well where are we going?

   Amy: We’re going to go put this painting back up in your
   apartment.

   Penny: Well, what about Bernadette?

   Amy: Oh, screw her. She’s just lucky we let her hang out with
   us.

   Scene: Rothman’s office. Sheldon is trying to affix paper over
   a fiercely blowing air vent.

   Leonard: What are you doing?

   Sheldon: I’m trying to raise the temperature in here before my
   nipples tear through my shirt.

   Howard: Why don’t you just turn up the thermostat?

   Sheldon: Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my
   new office isn’t in my new office. No. It’s next door, in
   Professor Davenport’s office, who is currently enjoying the hot
   flashes associated with menopause.

   Leonard: Why is there a hole here?

   Sheldon: Why is there a hole in my new office? I’ve narrowed it
   down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that
   someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there
   was something in the wall that wanted out.

   Raj: Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That’s
   nice.

   Sheldon: Is it? Listen.

   Raj: What, you don’t like wind chimes?

   Sheldon: No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.

   Howard: The bird?

   Sheldon: Yeah, It’s completely out of tune with the wind
   chimes.

   Raj: So?

   Sheldon: You don’t get it, do you? That’s a mockingbird.
   Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he’s out of
   tune on purpose. He’s mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again.
   Do you feel it?

   Howard: The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard?
   Yep.

   Sheldon: No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the
   geology lab, and they’re running their confounded sieve shakers
   again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try
   jiggling your heads around!

   Leonard: Sheldon, relax.

   Sheldon: How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched
   out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds
   and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict
   Professor Rothman.

   Leonard: If you’re not happy, why don’t you just let Kripke
   have the office?

   Sheldon: What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We’re
   trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!
   (To the bird) And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick
   one or I am chopping down that tree!

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: How’s that?

   Amy: Little higher on the right.

   Penny: Now?

   Amy: Little more. No. That’s got it.

   Penny: Yeah, okay. That’s, uh, that’s good.

   Amy: I’ll let you in on a little secret.

   Penny: Mm.

   Amy: Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add
   clothes, ’cause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to
   our heterosexuality.

   Penny: Yeah, good call.

   Amy: But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is
   some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.

   Penny: You’re talking about the painting, right?

   Amy: Sure.

   Scene: Rothman’s office. Sheldon has his head stuck in the hole
   in the wall.

   Sheldon: Help! Somebody help!

   Leonard: What happened?

   Sheldon: I was trying to see what was in here and my head got
   stuck.

   Leonard: Why would you do that?

   Sheldon: It’s called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.

   Leonard: Hang in there. I’ll be right back. (Takes out phone
   and takes a photo. Sits down and starts posting it online.)
