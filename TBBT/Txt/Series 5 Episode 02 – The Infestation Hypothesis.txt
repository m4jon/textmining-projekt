Series 5 Episode 02 – The Infestation Hypothesis

   Scene: The apartment. Leonard is laying out wine and napkins in
   front of his laptop.

   Sheldon: What are you doing?

   Leonard: Oh, uh, Priya’s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and
   we are gonna have a dinner date.

   Sheldon: It’s eight o’clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can
   she have dinner?

   Leonard: Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.

   Sheldon: All right, so technically it’s not a dinner date. I
   suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did,
   you’d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey,
   Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?

   Leonard: That doesn’t sound like mocking.

   Sheldon: You didn’t let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are
   those soy-based candles?

   Leonard: I don’t know. Why?

   Sheldon: Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung
   cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast.
   Dinfast (rolls eyes).

   Leonard: Listen, I don’t want to be rude, but Priya’s gonna be
   calling any minute, so…

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of
   never interfering in your personal affairs.

   Leonard: Yes, I’ve always admired that about you.

   Sheldon: As well you should. But I’m going to make an exception
   here.

   Leonard: Oh, good.

   Sheldon: Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law
   career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this
   intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to
   take up a hobby.

   Leonard: A hobby?

   Sheldon: Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an
   enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his
   money.

   Leonard: You know, some people might say that it’s great that
   we’re trying to make things work long distance. They’d say
   things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.

   Sheldon: When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.

   Leonard: You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this
   different?

   Sheldon: Don’t you like Amy?

   Leonard: Of course I like Amy.

   Sheldon: Well, there’s the difference. (Skype tone rings)

   Leonard: Excuse me, that’s Priya.

   Priya (on screen): Hi, Leonard.

   Leonard: Hey, honey.

   Priya: I miss you.

   Leonard: Oh, I miss you, too.

   Sheldon: I miss the old days when your romantic partners could
   be returned to the video store.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes
   with his girlfriend.

   Penny: Oh, it’s no problem. It’s actually kind of nice. You
   reading, me reading. We’re like an old married couple.

   Sheldon: If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve
   iced tea and snickerdoodles.

   Penny: I don’t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.

   Sheldon: A good wife would go to the store.

   Penny: I want a divorce.

   Sheldon: Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea
   and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.

   Penny: It’s great, isn’t it?

   Sheldon: It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances
   the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.

   Penny: What name?

   Sheldon: Chair.

   Penny: Oh, all right, well, I’m glad you like it. I mean, I
   still can’t get over the fact someone just threw it away.

   Sheldon: What?

   Penny: Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a
   homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.

   Sheldon (jumps up): Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (Starts
   stripping off clothing)

   Penny: What is wrong?

   Sheldon: I’ve been sitting in garbage!

   Penny: Sheldon, take it easy.

   Sheldon: You take it easy! I need to use your shower.

   Penny: I went into this marriage with so much hope.

   Sheldon: There’s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out
   of apartment).

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Raj: This is fun. I’ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming
   press before.

   Howard: Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university
   back 175 grand.

   Leonard: That’s three minutes. Should we see what we got?

   Howard: Hang on.

   Raj: Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.

   Howard: Hand me the tuna melt.

   Leonard: Yep.

   Howard: Thank you. How’s it going with the long-distance love
   affair?

   Leonard: Not easy, but we’re making it work.

   Howard: When you say making it work, does that include doing
   the cyber nasty?

   Leonard: What?

   Howard: You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital
   bow-chicka-bow-bow.

   Raj: Come on, dude. This is my sister you’re talking about.

   Howard: Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam
   has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually
   touching her with it.

   Leonard: There’s no junk jiggling. We just talk.

   Howard: Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at
   your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex
   since the invention of the washcloth.

   Leonard: I can’t do that.

   Howard: Well, if you don’t, you’re gonna lose Priya to some
   fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring
   books.

   Raj: How can you be so racist?

   Howard: Oh, come on, tell me I’m wrong.

   Sheldon (entering): Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need
   you to check my head for chair lice.

   Leonard: I did it last night, I’m not doing it again.

   Howard: Just his head, right?

   Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it. You didn’t catch bugs
   from Penny’s chair.

   Sheldon: Yes, I did. And now they’re cavorting at the base of
   my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National
   Forest.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some
   crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.

   Sheldon: Name one time I’ve ever done that.

   Leonard: How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage
   because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing
   your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human
   nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you
   around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were
   convinced you’d started growing again.

   Sheldon: I said, name one. You really need to work on your
   listening skills.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment door.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: Yello.

   Sheldon: You need to remove that chair from the building. It’s
   a health hazard.

   Penny: Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them
   dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.

   Sheldon: Really?

   Penny: Yeah. It’s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot
   Pocket in there.

   Sheldon: It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical
   smell. That’s reassuring.

   Penny: Why don’t you give it a try, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: All right. It is a comfortable chair.

   Penny: Why don’t you just admit you overreacted?

   Sheldon: No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all
   over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up
   and runs out to Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: It’s like living with a Chihuahua.

   Sheldon (at Penny’s door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock,
   knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: What’s up, buttercup?

   Sheldon: You have to get rid of the chair.

   Penny: Nope. (Closes door)

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: What’s the word, hummingbird?

   Sheldon: For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call
   the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.

   Penny: No. (Closes door)

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: What’s the gist, physicist?

   Sheldon: Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the
   Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are
   condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen
   sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with
   the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.
   (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat
   cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He
   sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.

   Leonard: So, here we are. Back in bed together.

   Priya (on laptop screen): Yep, here we are.

   Leonard: Okay, so I, I, I guess I’ll just jump right in.

   Priya: All right.

   Leonard: Uh, you’re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to
   punish you with my love?

   Priya: What?

   Leonard: Not good?

   Priya: That’s terrible. Try again.

   Leonard: Okay. Uh, uh, you’re not naughty. Uh, you’re, you’re,
   you’re dirty. You’re, you’re a, a dirty girl?

   Priya: Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

   Leonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You’re a, you’re a, you’re a, a
   dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!

   Priya: God, Leonard, stop talking.

   Leonard: Why don’t you just give me five minutes? I’ll Google
   how to do this. I’ll call you right back.

   Priya: Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.

   Leonard: Okay, like usual. Good.

   Priya: Take off your shirt.

   Leonard: All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.

   Priya: I said be quiet.

   Leonard: Yes, ma’am.

   Priya: Now take off your shorts.

   Leonard: Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!

   Priya: Wonderful. Now I’ll take off my clothes.

   Leonard: Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!

   Priya: Here I am, baby. You miss these?

   Leonard: Oh, damn it!

   Priya: Oh, Leonard! Already?

   Leonard: No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It’s probably just
   buffering, just give it a second.

   Priya: Fine.

   Leonard: So, how are your mom and dad?

   Priya: Yeah, I really don’t want to talk about my parents now.

   Leonard: Yeah. Sure, sure.

   Sheldon (calling from outside): If your video’s frozen, try
   resetting the TCP/IP stack.

   Leonard: Oh! I didn’t even think of that. Thanks.

   Sheldon (still off): You’re welcome. Please let me know when
   you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your
   self-abuse. I’m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is playing a harp.

   Amy: Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and
   lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she
   passes, each one she passes goes…

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.
   (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.

   Amy: Oh… You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour
   is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?

   Sheldon: Is not. Is not, is not.

   Amy: Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Amy: Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on
   the harp?

   Sheldon: No.

   Amy: How about the theme song to the classic television show
   Diff’rent Strokes? Now the world don’t move to the beat…

   Sheldon: No.

   Amy: Well, that’s every song I know. What’s up?

   Sheldon: You’re good friends with Penny, right?

   Amy: Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who
   would share travelling pants. Go on.

   Sheldon: I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers
   of owning unhygienic furniture.

   Amy: For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a
   bar stool dipped in cholera?

   Sheldon: Cholera is water-borne. You’re mocking me.

   Amy: Yes, I am.

   Sheldon: Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose
   unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every
   resident in our building.

   Amy: Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness
   bordering on the psychotic doesn’t mean I have to participate.

   Sheldon: All right, name your price.

   Amy: Kiss me where I’ve never been kissed before.

   Sheldon: You mean like Salt Lake City?

   Amy: Never mind. I’ll talk to Penny.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Amy: Will you listen to me play my harp now?

   Sheldon: No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in
   classic television sitcoms always makes me think I’m going to
   experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I’m
   sorry, Mommy. Don’t be mad at me. Don’t do that!

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Leonard: I don’t know about this, Howard.

   Howard: What? You’re having trouble with the long-distance
   lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that
   simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India.
   When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits
   exactly what you’re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing.
   (Howard kisses device) Give it a try.

   Leonard: I don’t think so.

   Raj: I’ll try it. Like this?

   Howard: Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate
   the motion sensor.

   Raj: Like this?

   Howard: Close. Really French it.

   Raj: Better?

   Howard: Yeah, you got it, you got it.

   Raj: I’m impressed. This is very lifelike.

   Howard: Whoa! You just bit my tongue!

   Raj: I, I nibbled. I was being playful.

   Howard: Why do you have to make everything weird?

   Raj: Sorry. Better?

   Howard: Oh, yeah.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred
   bucks in a store.

   Amy: I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once
   belonged to my dead grandmother.

   Penny: You’re kidding.

   Amy: Everything except bra and panties. And they’re a
   leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.

   Penny: And now me.

   Amy: I just have one question about the chair.

   Penny: And what’s that?

   Amy: Aren’t you worried about it being unhygienic?

   Penny: No, it’s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent
   you. He put you up to this.

   Amy: No, he didn’t.

   Penny: Really?

   Amy: Yes, he did. He absolutely did.

   Penny: My God, Amy, that’s really crappy of you.

   Amy: It is?

   Penny: Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I
   thought you were my friend.

   Amy: No, I am your friend. Please don’t be mad at me.

   Penny: I can’t even believe this. You know, maybe you should
   just go.

   Amy: No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I take it all back. Look.
   I’m, uh, I’m sitting in your chair. There’s nothing wrong with
   it. It’s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of
   your world. Ow!

   Penny: What’s wrong?

   Amy: Something in the chair’s biting my tushy. It’s not
   important. Ow!

   Penny: Wait. Get up, get up! (She does. Something is moving in
   the seat cushion. They both run out of the apartment
   screaming.) Swear you won’t tell Sheldon what happened!

   Amy (between screams): I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I’m
   probably gonna need shots!

   Penny (also still screaming): Yeah, sure!

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.

   Leonard: Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.

   Priya (on screen): Oh, Leonard, listen…

   Leonard: No, you listen. You’re my woman, and I’m gonna make
   you feel things you have never felt before.

   Priya: Leonard…

   Leonard: That’s right, say my name, and beg me for more,
   ’cause, I’m gonna give it to you.

   Priya: My parents are here.

   Dr Koothrappali: Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.

   Scene: The street outside the apartment block.

   Howard: Check it out. Free chair.

   Raj: Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard’s
   apartment, I wouldn’t wind up sitting on the floor all the
   time.

   Howard: On three?

   Together: Three!

   Raj: What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
