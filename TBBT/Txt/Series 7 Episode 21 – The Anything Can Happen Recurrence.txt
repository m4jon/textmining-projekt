Series 7 Episode 21 – The Anything Can Happen Recurrence

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: So, we’re about to shoot this scene in the movie where
   the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.

   Leonard: Okay.

   Penny: But I realize they’re gluing fur everywhere except my
   cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it’s
   important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn
   ape.

   Leonard: It’s sweet that he thinks there’s a story.

   Penny: Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go
   to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed
   like half an ape and still not even close to the most
   disgusting person in there.

   Sheldon: Leonard, I could use your assistance.

   Leonard: Sure. What’s up?

   Sheldon: Well, now that I’ve given up string theory, I’m
   struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your
   professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the
   most promising?

   Leonard: Huh, well, I think there’s some really innovative
   stuff going on in dark matter.

   Sheldon: That’s helpful. Okay. Of these four areas…

   Penny: Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Penny: Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?

   Sheldon: It is just so frustrating.

   Penny: ‘Cause you’re trying too hard. You need to do something
   else, get your mind off it.

   Leonard: Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen
   Thursdays?

   Penny: Hey, that’s good. Why’d you guys stop doing that?

   Leonard: You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.

   Penny: Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?

   Sheldon: All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen
   Thursday.

   Leonard: Great, what do you want to do?

   Sheldon: I don’t know. What do you want to do?

   Penny: I don’t know. What do you want to do?

   Leonard: I’m starting to remember the problem with Anything Can
   Happen Thursdays.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Hmm, what can we do that’s fun?

   Leonard: What can we do that’s different?

   Penny: What can we do that’s free?

   Sheldon: Oh, got it. We order a pizza.

   Penny: Are you kidding? That’s what you always do. Think
   harder.

   Sheldon: You’re right. You’re right. Got it. We order calzones,
   cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I’ll
   shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it.
   There’s a live-action role-playing group that meets every
   Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord
   of the Rings.

   Penny: Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.

   Leonard: You know what? Why don’t we just ease into this. Let,
   let’s go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new
   restaurant.

   Sheldon: Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: All right.

   Leonard: Raj and Howard are at Howard’s mom’s, but should we
   call the girls and see if they want to come?

   Penny: No. Bernadette’s working late.

   Sheldon: Amy’s sick.

   Leonard: Aw. What’s wrong with her?

   Sheldon: Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.

   Leonard: That’s not what I meant.

   Sheldon: Well, if you were referring to her illness your
   question should have been, what ails her?

   Leonard: What ails her?

   Sheldon: Oh. Who knows?

   Penny: Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the
   stairs.

   Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.

   Howard: Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.

   Raj: No problem. How’s your mom feeling?

   Howard: Okay, but she’d feel better if she took her medicine.

   Raj: You know, when Cinnamon won’t take her medicine, I hide it
   in a piece of cheese.

   Howard: Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to
   Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel
   like doing?

   Raj: I was thinking we could watch a DVD.

   Howard: Well, my mom doesn’t have a lot to choose from. Unless
   you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert,
   20 minutes in they find a prune pit.

   Raj: Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000
   Corpses?

   Howard: A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.

   Raj: I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to
   watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you
   first, then I could act cool about it with her.

   Howard: That’s actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the
   colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a
   prune pit.

   Raj: Uh, so, you’ll watch it?

   Howard: Sure.

   Raj: You’re a good friend. I owe you one.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard. Help me get out of the tub.

   Raj: Not that one.

   Scene: The street.

   Sheldon: So, we’re just randomly choosing a restaurant without
   researching it online?

   Penny: Yep.

   Sheldon: Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen
   Thursday turns into It Won’t Stop Coming Up Friday.

   Leonard: Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?

   Sheldon: Fusion and Asians? I’m trying not to think about
   science.

   Penny: What the hell? What? She’s not working late.

   Sheldon: And Amy doesn’t look sick.

   Penny: Why would they lie to us?

   Sheldon: That’s a good question. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and
   Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock,
   knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?

   Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.

   Raj: Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic
   rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.

   Howard: I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I’m one
   slippery horror ahead of you.

   Raj: You’re a good son. I don’t know how you do it.

   Howard: Beach blankets, my friend, it’s all about beach
   blankets.

   Raj: All right, let’s get this over with. Ew, it’s got
   someone’s hair on it.

   Howard: Oh, yeah, you’re gonna do great with this movie.

   Scene: A bar.

   Penny: You’re not working late. Why did you lie to me?

   Sheldon: And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just
   as pale and tired as always.

   Amy: I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess
   about what to do after string theory.

   Bernadette: We kind of just wanted one night where we didn’t
   have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.

   Amy: But none of that means we don’t love you.

   Penny: I haven’t been complaining that much about the movie.
   Have I?

   Leonard: I also love you.

   Penny: Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of
   you. Come on, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Where are we going?

   Penny: We’re gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you’re
   gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I’m gonna
   complain about my movie, and we’re gonna support each other
   because that’s what friends do.

   Sheldon: Okay. ‘Cause if I had to pick now, I’d probably go
   with dark matter because…

   Penny: Shut up.

   Scene: A restaurant. Sheldon makes an “unsure” noise.

   Penny: What’s wrong?

   Sheldon: I don’t understand my food. Chinese noodles with
   Korean barbecue in a taco.

   Penny: It’s fusion.

   Sheldon: My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive
   through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

   Penny: Think I’ve been complaining too much about the movie?

   Sheldon: Not at all.

   Penny: Thank you.

   Sheldon: But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say
   sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.

   Penny: Hey, I don’t understand why you’re not upset with Amy.

   Sheldon: I am. So much so that I’m gonna bring her here for
   dinner on our next date night.

   Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.

   Raj: Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we’ve seen a crazy woman
   kissing a fetus in a jar. We’ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn
   to a fish.

   Howard: And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by
   my mother.

   Raj: On the bright side, she didn’t even notice the pill. Why
   does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there’s something
   psychologically wrong with her?

   Howard: What difference does it make?

   Raj: What do you mean?

   Howard: Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of
   ex-boyfriend’s body parts and you’d still go out with her.

   Raj: I do like that the ex-boyfriend’s out of the picture.

   Scene: The bar.

   Amy: I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make
   it up to him?

   Bernadette: I’d tell you what I do with Howard, but I don’t
   think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with
   Sheldon.

   Leonard: He’d probably give you homework.

   Amy: Did you lie to Howard about tonight?

   Bernadette: Of course.

   Amy: And you don’t feel guilty about it?

   Bernadette: Between Penny’s gorilla movie and Howard’s gorilla
   mother, I had no choice.

   Leonard: Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on
   honesty. What? I don’t lie to her.

   Bernadette: Oh, we know you don’t lie to her.

   Scene: The restaurant.

   Penny: Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question
   is in one of these.

   Sheldon: Penny, there’s only one cookie with something in the
   middle that solves life’s problems, and that’s an Oreo. Or a
   Nutter Butter, if you’re in a pinch.

   Penny: Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.

   Sheldon: This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there’s a tiny
   Chihuahua in here.

   Penny: Fine, I’ll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and
   wisdom. Yeah, that’s a good one.

   Sheldon: No, it’s not.

   Penny: How is that not good?

   Sheldon: Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is
   mocking you. You’d never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter
   Butter.

   Penny: Uh, since you’re paying for dinner, I’ll let that slide.
   Open yours.

   Sheldon: Have you ever paid for a meal?

   Penny: Not with money. Read.

   Sheldon: Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around
   you.

   Penny: Oh, try again.

   Scene: Howard’s mother’s house.

   Howard: Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl’s
   father, cuts off the guy’s face, and is wearing it as a mask
   while he makes out with her.

   Raj: I’m just gonna say it. That’s not okay. Why can’t I be in
   a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?

   Howard: Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The
   Sound of Music. (Phone rings) Hey, Penny. What’s up? No,
   Bernie’s working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.

   Raj: What?

   Howard: I’m having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.

   Scene: The street. Outside a psychic’s shop.

   Penny: Oh, I think I see our next stop.

   Sheldon: You can’t be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on
   nonsense, I’d follow Leonard on Instagram.

   Penny: No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.

   Sheldon: Oh. That’s a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie
   on fire.

   Scene: Outside the bar.

   Bernadette (on phone): Yeah, honey, I’m still stuck at work.
   Really? Penny said that? Okay, it’s true. I’m sorry. I’ll see
   you at home. Yeah, yeah, I’ll put it on.

   Leonard: You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?

   Amy: I know, it’s weird, right?

   Leonard: Yeah. We should do it more often.

   Amy: Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.

   Leonard: (Phone text sound) Ah, it’s Penny.

   Amy: Is she still mad?

   Leonard: Oh, doesn’t seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a
   psychic with her.

   Amy: A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but
   extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.

   Leonard: Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She’s gotten me to
   do a lot of things I wouldn’t normally do.

   Amy: Because she has sex with you.

   Leonard: Yeah, she does.

   Amy: Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little
   jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.

   Leonard: Really?

   Amy: I mean, not in a romantic way. It’s just, she really has
   some sort of connection with him.

   Leonard: Well, well they’ve known each other a long time, and
   Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him
   without making him skittish.

   Amy: Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad they’re friends. I just wish
   he’d be that comfortable around me already.

   Leonard: Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable
   around me, too.

   Amy: Really? What did you do?

   Leonard: Something terrible in a former life? I don’t know.

   Bernadette: I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she’s getting
   you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your
   wallet.

   Scene: The psychic shop.

   Sheldon: I don’t mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we
   begin, I’d just like to say there is absolutely no scientific
   evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and
   again, no insult intended, that you’re a fraud, your profession
   is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the
   gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.

   Penny: All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.

   Sheldon: Okay, I just did. What was it?

   Penny: Oh, for God’s sake. Look, he’s a physicist who’s trying
   to figure out what his next field of study should be.

   Sheldon: For your information, I was asking her about the next
   Star Trek movie.

   Penny: Okay, I can answer that one, I’ll be bored.

   Psychic: All right, why don’t we begin? Your spirit guides are
   telling me that there’s a woman in your life you’re having
   problems with.

   Sheldon: That’s an easy guess. I’m clearly an annoying person
   and have problems with both genders.

   Psychic: Yes, you clearly are. But I’m seeing a specific woman
   that you’re in a romantic relationship with.

   Penny: Oh, oh, here we go.

   Psychic: Does she have dark hair?

   Penny: Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.

   Sheldon: The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at
   one time.

   Psychic: Does she work in a similar field to you?

   Sheldon: Ha. The opposite. She’s a neurobiologist, and I’m a
   theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.

   Psychic: They’re telling me that you have difficulty being
   close with her.

   Penny: Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?

   Psychic: He should give himself to this relationship. Once he
   does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.

   Penny: Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to
   your happiness.

   Psychic: Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything
   will fall into place once you commit to her.

   Sheldon: You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word
   for those rare instances when it’s truly deserved. This is
   malarkey.

   Penny: Wow, you really struck a nerve. I’ve never heard him use
   the M word before.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj: Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.

   Emily: Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so
   if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.

   Raj: Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of
   movies really aren’t my thing, so, last night, I watched it
   just to see what I was getting myself into.

   Emily: Okay.

   Raj: And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and
   weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who
   enjoys it.

   Emily: I wonder that, too.

   Raj: Then, why do you watch these things?

   Emily: Can I tell you something without you judging me?

   Raj: Sure.

   Emily: They kind of turn me on.

   Raj: And play.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Hello. I didn’t expect you this evening.

   Amy: Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the
   other night, I wanted to make it up to you.

   Sheldon: And how do you propose to do that? (Amy takes off coat
   and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl) Unless you have
   Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don’t know where you’re
   going with this.
