Series 5 Episode 22 – The Stag Convergence

   Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon laughs to himself.

   Sheldon: I wish you could all be inside my head. The
   conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I’ll tell you. A
   lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi
   and algae. If you could merge with another species, what
   species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer.
   None of you will get it.

   Raj: Okay, uh, I’d pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid
   would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and
   the long graceful neck I’ve always dreamed of having.

   Sheldon: Wrong. Leonard?

   Leonard: Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit
   for the genital girth.

   Sheldon: Wrong, and let’s keep it clean, shall we?

   Howard: Kangaroo, uh, I’d be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my
   people to dunk a basketball.

   Leonard: Also instead of just living in your mother’s house,
   you could actually live inside her body.

   Sheldon: Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for
   human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way,
   you’d be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like
   three-bean salad.

   Leonard: Give me one circumstance in which that would be
   useful.

   Sheldon: All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert.
   Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a
   terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no
   thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I’ll
   just snack on this sunlight.

   Raj: He got us again.

   Leonard: No, he didn’t.

   Raj: Anyway, if it’s okay with you, we should talk about
   Howard’s bachelor party.

   Sheldon: Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen
   conversation, but, what do you know, you’re half swan.

   Raj: I’ve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I
   spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we’re flexible
   on age range and number of limbs.

   Howard: Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no
   strippers.

   Raj: You don’t want strippers? You’re the king of strippers.
   The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.

   Howard: What can I tell ya, I’m not into that stuff any more.

   Leonard: Good for you, Howard. I’m proud of you. And still,
   you’re the first one of us to get married. We have to do
   something special.

   Sheldon: You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding
   custom.

   Howard: Well, it’s probably not for me.

   Raj: Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They’ve got that wine
   train.

   Sheldon: Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I’m in.

   Raj: Anyway, it’s a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel
   through the vineyards. There’s a tasting on board. And all the
   wild flowers are in bloom. It’s magic.

   Leonard: Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women
   to being them.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Penny: So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor
   party tonight.

   Leonard: Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and
   scotch. Nothing to worry about.

   Penny: Why should I worry?

   Leonard: Well, I don’t know. It’s a bachelor party. There could
   be strippers. Wouldn’t that make you a little jealous?

   Penny: Oh, come on Leonard, it’s you. What’s going to happen? I
   mean, even if there was a stripper, all you’d do is avoid
   eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.

   Leonard: Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the
   right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.

   Penny: Really? What is the craziest thing you’ve ever done with
   a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not
   count.

   Leonard: Oh, come on, that’s got to count. There was a really
   strong undertow, we could have died.

   Penny: Well, have fun tonight.

   Leonard: Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.

   Penny: Yeah, there is.

   Leonard: You know, there’s nothing wrong helping some woman’s
   kid get through their S.A.T.’s.

   Scene: A restaurant.

   Leonard: Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice
   spot to have a bachelor party.

   Sheldon: It’s not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then
   it stinks.

   Leonard: Are you drinking whisky?

   Sheldon: Indeed. If I’m to participate in the social convention
   that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components,
   including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers!
   That’s yucky.

   Leonard: Whoa, it’s a little early to start dropping J-bombs,
   don’t you think?

   Wil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.

   Leonard: Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for
   Howard.

   Wil: Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at
   George Takei’s house.

   Sheldon: I’m confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I
   was your friend in this group.

   Wil: Oh, I’m friends with Howard too.

   Sheldon: Oh. I guess you’re just friends with anybody. (Drinks)
   Aagh!

   Stuart: Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the
   comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of
   the check.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah, no worries.

   Stuart: And maybe a few bucks for the valet.

   Leonard: Oh, all right.

   Stuart: And gas money to get home.

   Leonard: Yeah, sure.

   Stuart: Great. You know what? This is my grandfather’s watch.

   Leonard: Oh.

   Stuart: 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.

   Leonard: Wow, that’s very nice.

   Stuart: Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it’s yours.

   Raj: Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he’s a
   jolly good fellow…

   All (joining in): For he’s a jolly good fellow, for he’s a
   jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.

   Kripke: Yes, yes, yes. He’s a jowwy good fewwow. What time do
   the stwippers awwive?

   Howard: Actually, Barry, we’re not going to have strippers
   tonight.

   Kripke: Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in
   singles out for?

   Stuart: You want to buy a watch?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Amy (into a mini-cam): This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah
   Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from
   the big day. Let’s check in with a beautiful, radiant young
   woman, and her friend who’s about to get married. Ladies, can
   you tell us what you’re doing?

   Bernadette: Um, these are gift bags we’re going to put in the
   hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of
   Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for
   Howie’s relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and
   medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.

   Penny: Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.

   Amy: All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on
   your wedding night you’ll be consummating your marriage. What
   do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and
   wife?

   Bernadette: Amy, please.

   Amy: Keeping in mind that whoever’s on top may set the tone for
   the marriage.

   Penny: Okay, show’s over.

   Amy: Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night.
   Don’t you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it
   happened?

   Penny: I don’t care. Ask her things like are you going to take
   Howard’s name? Not who’s going to sit on who?

   Bernadette: I’ve actually been thinking I’m going to hyphenate:
   Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.

   Penny: Nice. You know, you should totally get
   BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps
   it up.

   Bernadette: Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our
   beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our
   family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family
   and his family were neighbours.

   Penny: Oh, that’s cool.

   Amy: No, it’s not. I’ll explain it to you later.

   Scene: The restaurant.

   Raj: May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to
   celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard
   Wolowitz.

   All: Hear! Hear!

   Sheldon: And, apparently, Wil Wheaton’s best friend.

   Wil: Sheldon…

   Sheldon: Talk to the hand.

   Raj: Does anyone have any words they’d like to say about our
   man of the evening?

   Sheldon: Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have
   prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour
   at Howard’s expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard,
   I always thought you’d be the last one of us to ever get
   married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right?
   Let’s see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you’re actually
   one of the most intelligent people I know. And that’s a zinger,
   because you’re not. I’ve always thought that you’d make someone
   a fine husband someday. Assuming you’d be able to get the
   parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them,
   which I don’t see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here.
   Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish
   you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don’t!

   Leonard: Sheldon…

   Sheldon: Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.

   Leonard: So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy
   bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all
   kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at
   the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I
   know, it was crazy. I wasn’t even wearing my Aquasocks. Then…

   Kripke: Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.

   Leonard: Right. To Howard.

   All: To Howard.

   Leonard: I totally had sex in the ocean.

   Stuart: Okay, I’ll go. Howard, when I think about you and
   Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can’t help
   but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have
   everything. Look at me. I’m 37. I sleep in the back of a comic
   book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man.
   To Howard.

   Raj: Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who’s next?

   Kripke: I’ll go. Howard, I’m gonna say something to you that
   evewybody’s thinking but no one has the couwage to say out
   woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the
   impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy
   nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That’s not
   unweasonable.

   Raj: Hear, hear.

   All: Hear, hear.

   Raj: Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down
   to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my
   ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn’t
   know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was
   pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life
   changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became
   my whole world.

   Kripke: Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. (Tucks a dollar in Raj’s
   pants.)

   Raj: I’m not done, but thank you. (Raj puts the dollar on the
   table. Stuart steals it.) I think back to all the good times we
   had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night
   telling each other all our secrets. I told him I’m addicted to
   pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.

   Howard: She was my second cousin.

   Sheldon: And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually.
   Ba-da-bazinga!

   Raj: Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and
   I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was
   Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the
   Howard humping hookers stories, that one’s my favourite!

   Howard: Okay, buddy, that’s it. Sit down.

   Raj: Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon
   costume at Comic-con?

   Howard: Don’t remember. Please sit down.

   Raj: The only threesome I’ve ever had in my life, and I’m proud
   to say it was with this man right here.

   Howard: Oh, please shut up.

   Raj: Oh, oh, don’t get me wrong, nothing happened with me and
   Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.

   Wil (filming on his phone): Oh, Internet, this is so going all
   over you.

   Sheldon: Jeepers, I’m drunk.

   Scene: Bernadette’s car.

   Howard: Thank you for picking us up. There’s a warning, right
   there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin’ heavy
   machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!

   Bernadette: Funny. You boys have a nice time?

   Howard: Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No
   hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.

   Bernadette: That’s nice.

   Howard: How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh,
   made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.

   Raj’s Voice: Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that
   one’s my favourite.

   Raj: You know, we’re not that far from my apartment. If you
   stop the car, I can walk from here.

   Bernadette: You ain’t goin’ anywhere, Threeway.

   Howard: Bernadette, listen…

   Bernadette: You lied to me. You said you told me about all the
   girls you’ve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin,
   the prostitute or Raj!

   Raj: Seriously, you don’t even have to stop the car. Anything
   under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.

   Howard: Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn’t hire
   the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj.
   That is not how we treat women in this country.

   Bernadette: Don’t you try and blame this on him.

   Raj: Thank you, Bernadette.

   Bernadette: Zip it, pervert!

   Scene: Bernadette’s apartment.

   Bernadette: I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m supposed to
   marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I’m not sure I even know
   who the man is any more.

   Amy: I’m curious what’s bothering you most, the borderline
   incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as
   the children’s cartoon?

   Penny: Amy, remember when we went over things that would be
   helpful and things that wouldn’t?

   Amy: Right. And that was…

   Penny: Not.

   Bernadette: When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to
   me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.

   Penny: Well, if that’s what you like, I’ll take you to the
   comic book store, the place is full of ’em.

   Bernadette: Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you
   know about all the creepy stuff he was into?

   Penny: Well, a little. You hear stuff.

   Bernadette: Why didn’t you tell me

   Penny: Well, I was gonna, but I didn’t think it would go past
   the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it
   wouldn’t go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past
   the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs
   were there, this is really on you.

   Bernadette: My God! I thought you were my friend. (Runs to
   bedroom)

   Amy: I don’t think that was helpful.

   Scene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.

   Howard: Hi, Bernie, it’s me again. Please call me back.

   Raj: Dude, I am so sorry.

   Howard: It’s not your fault, it’s mine. I did all that stuff,
   not you.

   Leonard: Actually, you did do one of them together.

   Sheldon: Here.

   Howard: What is this?

   Sheldon: You’re upset. The convention is to bring an upset
   person a hot beverage.

   Howard: No, but what is it?

   Sheldon: Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also,
   there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard
   when I moved in and it’s been bothering me for the last eight
   years. So, as they say, two birds.

   Howard: I don’t know what my next move is.

   Leonard: Well, Howard, I don’t know much about women.

   Howard: Yeah?

   Leonard: No, uh, that, that’s it. I don’t know much about
   women. Raj, you got anything?

   Raj: I’ve got the phone number of the tubby girl from
   Comic-Con.

   Howard: I’m not calling the girl from Comic-con.

   Raj: All right. More Sailor Moon for me.

   Sheldon: I just threw up the bachelor party.

   Scene: Bernadette’s apartment.

   Penny: Please come out, Bernadette. Let’s talk through this.

   Bernadette: No, leave me alone.

   Amy: Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine.
   Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?

   Penny: Amy.

   Amy: Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I’m just trying
   to clean up your mess.

   Howard (at the door): Oh, hi.

   Penny: Hey.

   Howard: I need to talk to Bernadette.

   Penny: Well, I don’t think she wants to talk to anyone right
   now.

   Howard: All right, well, could you at least give her a message?

   Penny: Yeah, sure, I guess.

   Howard: Tell her I’m really sorry, and if she doesn’t want to
   marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the
   guy that she’s disgusted by, is the guy that I’m disgusted by,
   too. But that guy doesn’t exist any more, he’s gone, and the
   reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let
   her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.

   Penny: Oh, my God, Howard. That’s the most beautiful thing I’ve
   ever heard. And it came out of you.

   Bernadette: Howie?

   Howard: Penny has a message for you.

   Bernadette: I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother’s,
   travels through walls.

   Howard: Do you want me to go?

   Bernadette: No. Come here. I’m still really mad at you.

   Howard: I get that.

   Bernadette: Is there anything else about your past I should
   know?

   Howard: Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened
   overseas. I’ll tell you later.

   Bernadette: Okay.

   Howard: So, is the wedding still on?

   Bernadette: Yeah, the wedding’s still on. (They hug)

   Amy: Oh, thank God. I’m still a maid of honour. (Joins in the
   hug)

   Penny: Oh, what the hell. (Joins in too)

   Amy: This is kind of hot.

   Scene: The laundry room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown.

   Leonard: Hello.

   Penny: What’s with the robe?

   Leonard (taking it off): I’m gonna have sex with you right
   here, right now, on that washing machine.

   Penny: No, you’re not.

   Leonard: Come on, please.

   Penny: If you want to do something, you can help me fold this
   sheet.

   Leonard: Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.
