Series 9 Episode 08 – The Mystery Date Observation

   After a “previously on” sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: I think it’s so adorable you’re making Sheldon
   breakfast.

   Leonard: Well, he’s having a rough time. Amy broke his heart,
   the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow
   followed him home.

   Penny: Aren’t you worried you’re making French toast on oatmeal
   day?

   Leonard: Ah, well, what’s this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to
   you, what I will now call gloatmeal.

   Penny: Oh, I don’t want credit for that.

   Sheldon: Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this
   fine morning.

   Leonard: You’re in a good mood.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of
   wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a
   new female companion.

   Penny: Oh. Good for you.

   Leonard: What brought this on?

   Sheldon: I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was
   hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.

   Penny: And you don’t want to make the same mistake with the
   next woman.

   Sheldon: No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can
   hyper-focus on my work again.

   Leonard: Hey, I made French toast sticks.

   Sheldon: On oatmeal day?

   Leonard: Ah, I also made oatmeal.

   Sheldon: Ooh, that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the
   prowl. You know what? You eat it. You’re married, it doesn’t
   matter what you look like.

   Penny: Don’t take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a
   crow.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.

   Howard: No problem.

   Raj: So what’s up?

   Sheldon: Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah
   Fowler for me. Now that I’m looking for my next girlfriend, it
   seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.

   Howard: You sure you’re up for that? She did hurt you.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, it’s all right. I think of my time with Amy as
   a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but
   ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.

   Raj: You’re not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba
   Bubba man.

   Howard: Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You’re crazy.

   Raj: Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.

   Sheldon: Gentlemen.

   Raj: Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.

   Howard: But what are you looking for?

   Sheldon: All I’m looking for is an educated, intelligent woman
   who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of
   view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable
   to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight.

   Howard: Isn’t that a little unreasonable?

   Sheldon: All right, fine, she doesn’t need her own point of
   view. Now, chop-chop.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Come on, Amy, show us the dress.

   Amy: Okay. But I’m really stepping outside of my comfort zone
   here.

   Penny: Uh, I don’t think any of your comfort zones are showing.

   Bernadette: Yeah, it’s your third date, maybe you could go more
   sexy.

   Amy: Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.

   Penny: No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain
   just popped out of my shirt.

   Amy: Do you have any heels higher than this? He’s pretty tall.

   Penny: Ooh.

   Bernadette: Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery
   man.

   Penny: Yeah, come on, tell us more.

   Amy: Well, I told you his name and that he’s tall. What more do
   you need?

   Bernadette: Did you kiss him yet?

   Amy: Just a little peck on the lips.

   Penny: Well, we’re your best friends, give us one more detail
   and we promise we’ll leave you alone.

   Amy: Fine. Um, he’s British. All right, that is a juicy one.

   Penny: All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?

   Bernadette: Tea and basketball?

   Amy: To that new Italian place on Walnut.

   Bernadette: Oh, nice.

   Amy: I’m gonna go look for other shoes.

   Penny: Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married
   Leonard.

   Bernadette: Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and
   get a look at this guy?

   Penny: We don’t even know what time they’re gonna be there.

   Bernadette: I’ll just call the restaurant, pretend I’m Amy and
   check the reservation.

   Penny: Damn, you’re sneaky.

   Bernadette: Yeah, but I’m little, so it’s adorable.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend
   is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.

   Sheldon: Are you sure? I’ve heard that on those sites, often
   when you think you’re corresponding with someone, it’s actually
   a computer program pretending to be a real person.

   Raj: And you’re afraid it’ll do a better job than you?

   Sheldon: Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a
   person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.

   Howard: If you don’t want to use dating Web sites, what do you
   suggest?

   Sheldon: Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed
   themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion
   remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of
   victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch
   Daredevil.

   Howard: You seriously think women would fight for you?

   Sheldon: People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?

   Howard: He’s right, he knows a lot of jokes.

   Raj: Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him
   as a prize, maybe they would.

   Howard: Well, he’s smart, he’s a respected scientist.

   Sheldon: And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.

   Raj: I don’t know if I’d say you… oh.

   Howard: I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist
   that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If
   interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet
   him.

   Sheldon: Oh, we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to
   eliminate unworthy candidates.

   Raj: Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the
   last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information.

   Howard: Well, this is actually an interesting social
   experiment.

   Raj: I’m a little jealous of the people who get to do it.

   Howard: Me, too. And we’ve seen the prize.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Leonard: I don’t understand why we’re leaving so early for the
   movie.

   Penny: Oh, I forgot to tell you, we’re gonna meet up with
   Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.

   Leonard: What? I don’t want to do that.

   Penny: What, and you think I want to see a documentary about
   aluminium can recycling?

   Leonard: This is the movie that big soda doesn’t want you to
   see.

   Penny: No, it’s the movie your wife doesn’t want you to see.

   Leonard: So you’re actually okay with invading your friend’s
   privacy?

   Penny: You’re not curious who she’s out with?

   Leonard: Not really.

   Penny: But you’re curious about aluminium cans? You’re a weird
   little guy.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: That’s it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is
   officially live.

   Howard: Congratulations.

   Raj: This is exciting.

   Sheldon: Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic
   weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the
   oldest national flag still in use.

   Howard: Then using that number as the average speed to
   calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.

   Sheldon: And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of
   laughter, love and, best of all, rules.

   Raj: I, I hope we didn’t make the puzzles too hard.

   Howard: Well, if she can solve them, it’ll prove she’s
   intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing
   better to do on a Saturday night.

   Sheldon: Golly, she sounds too good to be true.

   Scene: A restaurant.

   Tall British Dave: This is fun. I haven’t dated much since my
   divorce.

   Amy: Well, I’m having a good time, too. If you don’t mind me
   asking, why did you and your wife split up?

   Dave: Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I
   wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named
   Jean-Philippe.

   Amy: Oh, I’m, I’m so sorry.

   Dave: No, it’s, it’s fine. It’s why I left England. It reminded
   me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a
   Frenchman through a tunnel.

   (in the car outside)

   Penny: Hey. So, where are they?

   Bernadette: Across the street, in the left window.

   Penny: Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.

   Bernadette: Right here.

   Leonard: You just happen to have those in the car?

   Bernadette: Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close
   tabs on my boyfriends.

   Leonard: By stalking them?

   Bernadette: No. Stalkers are creepy. I’m just a harmless little
   girl with military-grade spy equipment.

   Penny: Oh, there he is.

   Bernadette: He’s cute, right?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Leonard: Can I see?

   Penny: What, now you’re interested? You didn’t even want to
   come.

   Leonard: I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look
   fun.

   Penny: Fine.

   Leonard: Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they’re having a
   nice time. I wish I could hear what they’re saying.

   Bernadette: Yeah, I should’ve brought my parabolic microphone.

   Penny: Your what?

   Bernadette: Nothing. Not important.

   Dave: So you’ve never been married?

   Amy: No. I mean, to be completely honest, I’ve, I’ve only been
   in one long-term relationship.

   Dave: Oh. What happened with that?

   Amy: That’s a good question. After five years, it was just
   feeling like more work than it should be.

   Dave: Oh, that’s too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?

   Amy: No. He’s a theoretical physicist at Caltech.

   Dave: I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job.
   What’s his focus?

   Amy: Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But
   let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you.

   Dave: Wait, you’re not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

   Amy: I’m trying not to. Do you know him?

   Dave: No, but I’ve followed his work for years. He’s a rock
   star. You’ve got to tell me about him. What’s he like?

   Penny: He really seems into her.

   Bernadette: I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.

   Leonard: Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?

   Bernadette: Why’d you bring him?

   Penny: I had to; we’re married now.

   Bernadette: Ugh, I hear that.

   Dave: I’m sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.

   Amy: Sure, why not?

   Dave: It’s more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote
   his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?

   Amy: Um about an hour and half.

   Dave: Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?

   Amy: Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.

   Dave: Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he’s a genius,
   and I wasn’t even smart enough to figure out why my wife always
   smelled of croissants.

   Amy: What was the rest of your question?

   Dave: Do you think you could introduce me to him?

   Amy: Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my
   ex-boyfriend?

   Dave: You’re right, it’s, it’s weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I
   changed my mind. I’d be too nervous. Oh, I don’t know what to
   do.

   Leonard: Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to
   the bathroom.

   Bernadette: Right here.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: 37 minutes left until the deadline.

   Sheldon: Someone will show.

   Howard: And no matter what happens, this is still a fun
   experiment.

   Raj: Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the
   microwave. We really have led full lives.

   Sheldon: Someone will show.

   Raj: Maybe you don’t want someone exactly like you. You know
   what they say, opposites attract.

   Sheldon: Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short,
   dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can’t shake a
   stick around here without hitting that.

   Scene: The restaurant.

   Dave: You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at
   Stanford.

   Amy: I have a DVD of that lecture.

   Dave: Really? Wasn’t it great?

   Amy: Not as a Valentine’s present, no.

   Dave: Well, the next time you watch it, I’m the bloke who asked
   the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the
   nicest thing he said to anyone there.

   Amy: That’s, um, terrific. Listen, I’m, I’m kind of tired. Can
   we call it a night?

   Dave: Oh, gosh. Sorry, I’ve just spent the whole night talking
   about your ex-boyfriend. I’m such an idiot.

   Amy: No, you’re not.

   Dave: Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as
   someone we won’t mention.

   Amy: Thank you.

   Dave: That you said you might introduce me to, I’m free on
   Thursday.

   Bernadette: Hey, hey, they’re leaving.

   Penny: What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
   they’re coming right towards us.

   Bernadette: We got to get out of here.

   Penny: Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?

   Bernadette: He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. (Reverses
   into car behind)

   Penny: Oh, no.

   Dave: She just hit my car.

   Amy: What are you guys doing here?

   Bernadette: Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?

   Leonard: What happened?

   Dave: O-M-G. Aren’t you Leonard Hofstadter?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Dave: I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can
   you believe it? It’s Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

   Amy: No. Pinch me.

   Dave: It’s an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your
   hand?

   Leonard: I don’t know if you want to do that, I was just, okay,
   never mind.

   Dave: Amy, I’m never washing this hand again.

   Leonard: You really should.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.

   Sheldon: One minute is a long time.

   Howard: I’ve been telling women that for 20 years.

   Raj: Forty-five.

   Sheldon: 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk
   through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably
   half that if I break out the old cow eyes.

   Raj: Thirty seconds.

   Sheldon: Uh-oh. What if it’s Jennifer Lawrence?

   Howard: What?

   Sheldon: Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.

   Howard: You thought she was great in X-Men.

   Sheldon: Oh, fine, I won’t shut my heart to the love of
   Jennifer Lawrence.

   Raj: Guys, fifteen seconds.

   Howard: Maybe she’s waiting to show up at the last possible
   moment.

   Sheldon: Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer
   Lawrence.

   Raj: Five, four, three, two, one. That’s too bad.

   Howard: Maybe we did make the test too difficult.

   Raj: I don’t think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when
   the time is right for you to meet someone, it’ll just happen.
   Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because… (knock
   on door) we are the dreamers of dreams.

   Howard: It’s an actual girl, and she’s really pretty.

   Raj: Answer it.

   Sheldon: All right. Can I help you?

   Girl: Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on
   Craigslist?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Girl: Hi. I’m Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to
   get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic
   spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night.
   The puzzles were, were really fun. I’ve never had to translate
   Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.

   Sheldon: Careful, it’s addictive.

   Vanessa: Chija”e’vlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm
   asman matey-bee ta-teyva.

   Sheldon: And just like that, you’re a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.

   Vanessa: Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person
   responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don’t need to tell
   you, there aren’t a lot of men who love physics, archaic
   languages and flags of the world.

   Sheldon: I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like
   a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline,
   so thanks for playing.

   Raj: How could you send her away?

   Sheldon: She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy
   boring. Well, I wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals.

   Scene: Amy’s car.

   Dave: Uh, thanks for driving me home.

   Amy: No problem. I’m really sorry about your car.

   Dave: Oh, it’s all right. If you’re free next weekend, I’d love
   to take you out again.

   Amy: Um, listen, you’re a really nice guy, but I just, I don’t
   think this is working out.

   Dave: Oh. Okay.

   Amy: I’m, I’m really sorry.

   Dave: No, it’s, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon
   Cooper rejected me.

   Amy: There you go.

   Dave: If I ever do meet him, we’ll have that in common.

   Amy: Sure. Heh.

   Dave: And, he’s kissed you and I’ve kissed you, so if you think
   about it…

   Amy: Okay, get out.
