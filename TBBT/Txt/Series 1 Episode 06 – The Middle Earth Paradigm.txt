Series 1 Episode 06 – The Middle Earth Paradigm

   Scene: Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon
   and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue paint.

   Raj: Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck
   at paintball.

   Howard: That was absolutely humiliating.

   Leonard: Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you
   lose.

   Howard: Yes, but you don’t have to lose to Kyle Bernstein’s
   Bar-Mitzvah party.

   Leonard: I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly
   savage pre-adolescent Jews.

   Sheldon: You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence
   and the inability of some people to follow the chain of
   command.

   Leonard: Sheldon, let it go.

   Sheldon: No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot
   me in the back.

   Howard: I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into
   disaster.

   Sheldon: I was giving clear, concise orders.

   Leonard: You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the
   yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”

   Penny (arriving): Oh, hey guys.

   Leonard: Hello Penny.

   Howard: Morning ma’am.

   Penny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?

   Sheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops
   fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will
   be an enquiry.

   Penny: Okay, um, oh hey, I’m having a party on Saturday so if
   you guys are around you should come by.

   Leonard: A party?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Howard: A boy-girl party?

   Penny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and
   it is a party. So, it’ll just be a bunch of my friends, we’ll
   have some beer, do a little dancing…

   Sheldon: Dancing?

   Leonard: Yeah, I don’t know, Penny…

   Sheldon: The thing is, we’re not….

   Leonard: We’re really more….

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.

   Penny: Are you sure? Come on, it’s Halloween.

   Sheldon: A Halloween party?

   Howard: As in, costumes?

   Penny: Well, yeah.

   Leonard: Is there a theme?

   Penny: Um, yeah, Halloween.

   Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?

   Penny: As usual, I’m not following.

   Leonard: He’s asking if we can come as anyone from
   science-fiction, fantasy…

   Penny: Sure.

   Sheldon: What about comic-books?

   Penny: Fine.

   Sheldon: Anime?

   Penny: Of course.

   Sheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse
   Gods…

   Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.

   Howard: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.

   Credits Sequence

   Scene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.

   Leonard (off): I’ll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash
   costume. Opens door.)

   Howard (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume): Bjow
   (They stare at each other in shock.)

   Leonard: Oh, no.

   Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)

   Raj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a
   Flash costume.) Oh no!

   Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting.

   Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.

   Raj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and
   look like one person going really fast.

   Howard: No, no, no, it’s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs
   solo.

   Leonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we
   all change, agreed?

   All: Agreed.

   Leonard: I call Frodo!

   All: Damn!

   Scene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard
   appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.

   Raj (Entering dressed as Thor): Hey. Sorry I’m late, but my
   hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.

   Leonard: You went with Thor?

   Raj: What? Just because I’m Indian I can’t be a Norse God? No,
   no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That’s racism. I mean,
   look at Wolowitz, he’s not English, but he’s dressed like Peter
   Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white
   vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he’s obviously
   the Doppler Effect.

   Howard: I’m not Peter Pan, I’m Robin Hood.

   Raj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you’re dressed
   exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but
   it’s basically the same look, man.

   Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, there’s something I want to talk to you
   about before we go to the party.

   Sheldon: I don’t care if anybody gets it, I’m going as the
   Doppler Effect.

   Leonard: No, it’s not…

   Sheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!

   Leonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny
   to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you
   not to embarrass me tonight.

   Sheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?

   Leonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my
   middle name is Leakey.

   Sheldon: Well, there’s nothing embarrassing about that, your
   father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had
   nothing to do with your bed-wetting.

   Leonard: All I’m saying is that this party is the perfect
   opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group.
   A potential close friend and… perhaps more. I don’t want to
   look like a dork.

   Scene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny’s door with his bow.

   Howard: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a
   dozen condoms in my quiver.

   Penny (opening door, not in costume): Oh, hey guys.

   Leonard: Hey, sorry we’re late.

   Penny: Late? It’s 7:05.

   Sheldon: And you said the party starts at seven.

   Penny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one
   shows up at, you know, seven.

   Sheldon: It’s 7:05.

   Penny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.

   Howard: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?

   Penny: Probably, but in their own homes.

   Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start?

   Penny: The parade?

   Sheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best
   costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most
   accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.

   Penny: Oh, Sheldon, I’m sorry but there aren’t going to be any
   parades or judges or prizes.

   Sheldon: This party is just going to suck.

   Penny: No, come on, it’s going to be fun, and you all look
   great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that’s so
   cute.

   Leonard: Actually, Penny, he’s Rob…

   Howard: I’m Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust
   with your name on it.

   Penny: No you don’t. Oh, hey, what’s Sheldon supposed to be.

   Leonard: Oh, he’s the Doppler Effect.

   Sheldon: Yes. It’s the apparent change in the frequency of a
   wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave
   and the observer.

   Penny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright,
   I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.

   Leonard: Okay.

   Sheldon: See, people get it.

   Time shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are
   sitting together around the coffee table.

   Raj: Mmmm, by Odin’s beard, this is good Chex Mix.

   Howard: No thanks, peanuts, I can’t afford to swell up in these
   tights.

   Sheldon: I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are
   we doing here?

   Leonard: We’re socialising. Meeting new people.

   Sheldon: Telepathically?

   Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone
   off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!

   Raj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever
   seen, and that includes Halle Berry’s.

   Leonard: She’s not Catwoman, she’s just a generic cat.

   Sheldon: And that’s the kind of sloppy costuming which results
   from a lack of rules and competition.

   Howard: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it’s time
   for me to turn my head and cough.

   Raj: What is your move?

   Howard: I’m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her
   hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug,
   subconsciously she’s thinking we’re in sync, we belong
   together.

   Leonard: Where do you get this stuff?

   Howard: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and
   there’s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.

   Raj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty
   speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even
   effeminate men.

   Howard: If that’s a working stethoscope, maybe you’d like to
   hear my heart skip a beat.

   Nurse Costume Girl: No thanks.

   Howard: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic
   arrhythmia.

   Leonard: I  want to get to know Penny’s friends, I just, I
   don’t know how to talk to these people.

   Sheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.

   Leonard: How so?

   Sheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw
   their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns
   emerge, they have their own language if you will.

   Leonard: Go on.

   Sheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the
   existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is
   met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”

   Leonard: Then what happens?

   Sheldon: That’s as far as I’ve gotten.

   Leonard: This is ridiculous, I’m jumping in.

   Sheldon: Good luck.

   Leonard: No, you’re coming with me.

   Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so.

   Leonard: Come on.

   Sheldon: Aren’t you afraid I’ll embarrass you?

   Leonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.

   Sheldon: Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors
   I’m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing
   wreckage.

   Girl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi!

   Leonard: Hi.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Girl: So, what are you supposed to be?

   Sheldon: Me? I’ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!

   Girl: Uh, a choo-choo train?

   Sheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!

   Girl: A brain damaged choo-choo train?

   Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj): How
   wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.)

   Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a
   princess costume.

   Sheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!

   Girl: I still don’t get it.

   Sheldon: I’m the Doppler Effect.

   Girl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I
   think it’s very insensitive.

   Leonard: Why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra?

    Sheldon: Well, why don’t you just tell people you’re one of
   the seven dwarves.

   Leonard: Because I’m Frodo.

   Sheldon: Yes, well, I’m the Doppler Effect.

   Leonard: Oh no.

   Sheldon: What?

   Leonard: That’s Penny’s ex-boyfriend.

   Sheldon: What do you suppose he’s doing here? Besides
   disrupting the local gravity field.

   Leonard: If he were any bigger, he’d have moons orbiting him.

   Sheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we’ll be leaving now.

   Leonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the
   party and Penny doesn’t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt
   hug).

   Sheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis.

   Leonard: Maybe they just want to be friends.

   Sheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants
   something more.

   Leonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.

   Sheldon: Yes, but you’re much closer to it than he is.

   Leonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his
   size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of
   female partners.

   Sheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial
   eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.

   Leonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift,
   in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males.
   We shouldn’t have to back down.

   Sheldon: True. Why don’t you text him that and see if he backs
   down?

   Leonard: No. I’m going to assert my dominance face to face.

   Sheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit
   down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?

   Leonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.

   Penny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?

   Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a
   scathing indictment of the American education system.

   Kurt: What, you’re a zebra, right?

   Sheldon: Yet another child left behind.

   Kurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?

   Leonard: No, I’m a Hobbit.

   Kurt: What’s the difference?

   Leonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle
   Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.

   Kurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?

   Sheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of
   us could be The Flash.

   Kurt: Well, whatever, why don’t you go hop off on a quest, I’m
   talking to Penny here.

   Leonard: I think we’re all talking to Penny here.

   Sheldon: I’m not. No offence.

   Kurt: Okay, maybe you didn’t hear me, go away.

   Penny: Alright Kurt, be nice.

   Kurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.

   Penny: Kurt!

   Leonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically
   intimidate me. I mean, you can’t compete with me on an
   intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery.

   Kurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal?

   Penny: Of course not, no, he’s not, you’re not, right Leonard?

   Leonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we’re all animals,
   but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary
   tree.

   Sheldon: If he understands that, you’re in trouble.

   Kurt: So what, I’m unevolved?

   Sheldon: You’re in trouble.

   Kurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little
   dwarf.

   Penny: Okay, Kurt, please.

   Leonard: No, Penny, it’s okay, I can handle this. I’m not a
   dwarf, I’m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your
   hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to
   long-term memory?

   Kurt: Okay, now you’re starting to make me mad.

   Leonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says
   what?

   Kurt: What?

   Leonard: I think I’ve made my point.

   Kurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little
   head.

   Sheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute,
   in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.

   Leonard: There’s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I
   doubt if he can even spell confrontation.

   Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground): C – O – N…
   frontation!

   Penny: Kurt, put him down this instant.

   Kurt: He started it.

   Penny: I don’t care, I’m finishing it, put him down.

   Kurt: Fine. You’re one lucky little leprechaun.

   Sheldon: He’s a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.

   Penny: Leonard, are you okay.

   Leonard: Yeah, no, I’m fine. It’s good, it’s a good party,
   thanks for having us, it’s just getting a little late so….

   Penny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.

   Sheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it’s any consolation,
   I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place.

   Scene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.

   Leonard: What’s that?

   Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is
   to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk
   about it?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Good. There there was really all I had.

   Leonard: Good night Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Good night Leonard.

   Penny (knocking on door and entering): Hey Leonard.

   Leonard: Hi Penny.

   Penny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you’re okay.

   Leonard: I’m fine.

   Penny: I’m so sorry about what happened.

   Leonard: It’s not your fault.

   Penny: Yes it is. That’s why I broke up with him, he always
   does stuff like that.

   Leonard: So why was he at your party?

   Penny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was…  just, all
   apologetic, about how he’s changed, he was just going on and on
   and I believed him, and I’m an idiot because I always believe
   guys like that and… I can’t go back to my party because he’s
   there, and I know you don’t want to hear this and I’m upset and
   I’m really drunk and I just want to… (bursts into tears and
   rests head on Leonard’s shoulder.)

   Leonard: There there.

   Penny: God, what is wrong with me.

   Leonard: Nothing, you’re perfect.

   Penny: Gah, I’m not perfect.

   Leonard: Yes you are.

   Penny: You really think so, don’t you? (She kisses hm.)

   Leonard: Penny?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Leonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?

   Penny: Just…. a lot.

   Leonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being
   angry with Kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going
   on here?

   Penny: It might. Boy, you’re really smart.

   Leonard: Yeah, I’m a frickin’ genius.

   Penny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can’t all guys be like
   you?

   Leonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race
   couldn’t survive.

   Penny: I should probably go.

   Leonard: Probably.

   Penny (in doorway): Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is
   watching.)

   Leonard: That’s right, you saw what you saw. That’s how we roll
   in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)

   Scene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door.

   Sheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)

   Howard: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?

   Sheldon: He’s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.

   Howard: He’s not the Marvel comic story, he’s the original
   Norse God.

   Sheldon: Thank you for the clarification.

   Howard: I’m supposed to give him a ride home.

   Sheldon: Well I’m sure he’ll be fine. He has his hammer.

   Scene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off
   of Raj.

   Butterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man.
   You’re gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good
   listener!

   (Raj puts hands behind head with a smug expression on his
   face.)
