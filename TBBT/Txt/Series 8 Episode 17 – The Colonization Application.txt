Series 8 Episode 17 – The Colonization Application

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Leonard: I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It
   was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like
   athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.

   Penny: Again, it was miniature golf.

   Leonard: Admit it, you’re a little turned on.

   Penny: You can’t be this proud.

   Leonard: Why not?

   Penny: Because I beat you.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Penny: Hi.

   Sheldon: Oh, good. You’re back.

   Amy: We have some exciting news.

   Leonard: Okay.

   Sheldon: As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time,
   and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.

   Penny: Okay.

   Amy: After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided
   that the time was right to take a step forward.

   Leonard: Okay.

   Sheldon: Do you want to say it?

   Amy: Let’s say it together.

   Together: We’re getting a turtle.

   Penny: This is why I’ve been saying we should keep champagne on
   ice.

   Sheldon: Sarcasm?

   Amy: Yes.

   Sheldon: Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to
   alcohol, she generally means business.

   Leonard: Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.

   Penny: Yes.

   Amy: Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.

   Sheldon: No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about
   each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce
   reptile.

   Leonard: Why a turtle?

   Sheldon: After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a
   turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make
   noise.

   Amy: For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.

   Sheldon: Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun
   him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.

   Leonard: Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two
   would be the first in our group to start a family?

   Penny: Mm-hmm.

   Amy: That’s what I said.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Emily’s apartment.

   Raj: So, where’s your roommate tonight?

   Emily: Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she’s always
   here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.

   Raj: But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering
   people, but you have to say just kidding.

   Emily: And the more important thing to remember is that I’d
   never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital
   and check on a patient.

   Raj: That’s okay. I can come back later.

   Emily: No. No, don’t be silly. I won’t be gone long. Just stay
   here.

   Raj: Okay, cool. Oh, and you’re sure your roommate’s not gonna
   come back while I’m here alone, right? ‘Cause that’ll be
   awkward.

   Emily: Oh, don’t worry. She’s in Palm Springs.

   Raj: Oh, good.

   Emily: Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood
   chipper.

   Scene: A pet store.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.

   Amy: It’s okay. You made it. We’re fine.

   Sheldon: That was a lot of puppies.

   Amy: Let’s forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice
   turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?

   Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How
   about this one?

   Amy: Well, he’s barely moving. He looks half dead.

   Sheldon: I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you
   like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we
   don’t live in the same house.

   Amy: But that’s not your fault. Like you, we’re taking it
   ridiculously slow. You’ll stay with me when he’s at Comic-Con
   or away for work.

   Sheldon: Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.

   Amy: What are you talking about?

   Sheldon: Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to
   establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first
   to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking
   Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.

   Amy: You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another
   planet, and couldn’t be bothered to tell me?

   Sheldon: Would you have approved?

   Amy: Of course not.

   Sheldon: Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the
   right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to
   make.

   Penny: Aw, is this your first time?

   Leonard: No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was
   too embarrassed to give it to you.

   Penny: Well, why?

   Leonard: Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.

   Penny: You went to the dirty store without me?

   Leonard: In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks
   away.

   Penny: Well, get it. Get it for me.

   Leonard: Yeah?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Leonard: Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes
   with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.

   Penny: Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?

   Leonard: No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then,
   then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.

   Penny: Whoa, that’s kind of a big step for a guy who only
   recently agreed to take his socks off.

   Leonard: You’re making fun of me. Forget it.

   Penny: No. No, come on, I want to do it.

   Leonard: Really?

   Penny: Yeah, let’s you, me, and your very, very pale feet make
   some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go
   with you.

   Leonard: Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San
   Diego.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: How are the taxes going?

   Bernadette: Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego
   store in here.

   Howard: Those are business expenses. You can write those off.

   Bernadette: A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?

   Howard: Oh, Bernie, you’re gonna have to sound a lot more
   confident when we get audited. (On phone) Hey, what’s up?

   Raj: Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I’m just hanging
   out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?

   Howard: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.

   Raj: What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner
   into little pieces, too?

   Howard: She doesn’t have to, I filled up on jelly beans.

   Raj: So, uh, what game are you… Oh. Crap.

   Howard: What’s wrong?

   Raj: I can’t get Emily’s night-stand to close.

   Howard: So?

   Raj: She’s gonna know I was looking in it.

   Howard: Why were you looking in it?

   Raj: Well, there’s a question I better have a good answer to
   before she gets back.

   Howard: Okay, calm down. There’s probably something jammed
   behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what’s there.

   Raj: Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.

   Howard: You know what, you sound busy, I’m gonna let you go.

   Raj: Dude, the whole front came off. Now she’s gonna know I was
   snooping.

   Bernadette: What’s happening?

   Howard: Raj was snooping through Emily’s drawers and broke one.

   Bernadette: Aw. I’m gonna miss her.

   Scene: Penny’s bedroom.

   Penny: So what do you think?

   Leonard: I thought it’d be a little more, just more.

   Penny: I’m not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean,
   did we move at all?

   Leonard: Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty
   sad.

   Penny: Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do
   better than this.

   Leonard: Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last
   night?

   Penny: Almost 1am.

   Leonard: Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even
   watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.

   Penny: Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now,
   come on. We are gonna do this.

   Leonard: Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40
   minutes, and then we do this.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal
   into my home.

   Amy: No one told you to poke the turtle’s face.

   Sheldon: I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get
   children to like you.

   Amy: I’m surprised you even care if he likes you, since you’re
   planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.

   Sheldon: Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole
   torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.

   Amy: Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are
   incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer
   for something that would take you away from me forever.

   Sheldon: So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance
   to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?

   Amy: I would at least mention it before filling out the
   application.

   Sheldon: Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz,
   Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.

   Amy: And who says you could even survive an interplanetary
   mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.

   Sheldon: First of all, this has only made me stronger. But
   beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.

   Amy: You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

   Amy: No. Forget it.

   Sheldon: What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?

   Amy: Please don’t.

   Sheldon: Yep, you’re mad.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment. Howard is on the
   phone to Raj.

   Howard: Okay, let me see the damage.

   Raj: Hang on.

   Howard: Well, I think you broke the dowels. You’re not gonna
   have time to glue it back on, you’ll have to nail it.

   Raj: With what?

   Howard: Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?

   Raj: She does.

   Howard: Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.

   Raj: Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is
   the red planet, I went with peppermint.

   Amy: Why do you even want to do this?

   Sheldon: Actually, as part of the application, I was required
   to make a short video answering that very question. You want to
   see it?

   Amy: Can’t you just tell me?

   Sheldon: But I made a video.

   Sheldon (on video): I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to
   tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly
   smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting
   an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away.
   Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my
   hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because
   I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month
   space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of
   humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that
   can?

   Leonard (on video): You mean this weirdly suspicious one?

   Sheldon (on video): Yes. Open it and check.

   Leonard (on video): I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut
   brittle in… Please go to Mars.

   Sheldon (on video): But on a more serious note, the most
   important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a
   scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human
   knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be
   difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics
   are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the
   ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this
   journey of a lifetime. To Mars.

   Sheldon: Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.

   Scene: Penny’s bathroom.

   Leonard: Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.

   Penny: How did you get paint in your eye?

   Leonard: Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.

   Scene: Emily’s bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard.

   Raj: This looks terrible. She, she’s gonna know.

   Howard: It’s fine. You just need two more nails.

   Raj: Okay, where should I put them?

   Howard: In Emily’s eyes.

   Raj: You’re not helping.

   Bernadette: Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.

   Raj: You know, it, it’s bad enough that I have to deal with
   this…

   Emily: Raj? I’m back.

   Raj: Oh, no. Hey.

   Emily: Hi.

   Raj: How was the hospital?

   Emily: Fine. What were you doing in there?

   Raj: Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don’t want to lie to you. I
   got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on
   your night stand.

   Emily: You were looking in my night stand?

   Raj: Yeah.

   Emily: So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?

   Raj: You’ve never snooped around my apartment?

   Emily: No.

   Raj: Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.

   Emily: I can’t believe you don’t trust me.

   Bernadette: She sounds really mad.

   Howard: We should hang up.

   Bernadette: Yeah, we should.

   Howard: But we’re not going to, are we?

   Bernadette: Not a chance.

   Howard: What happened to snooping is wrong?

   Bernadette: Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who
   cares?

   Scene: Penny’s bedroom.

   Leonard: Well, we did it.

   Penny: We sure did.

   Leonard: I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an
   athlete.

   Penny: Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.

   Leonard: So, where do we want to hang it?

   Penny: What? Are you kidding? We’re not hanging it.

   Leonard: But it’s an expression of our love.

   Penny: And our butts. Not hanging it.

   Leonard: Seems a shame to throw it away.

   Penny: Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William
   Shatner painted it.

   Leonard: God, I love you. I love you so much.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: I think I’m gonna go home.

   Sheldon: Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.

   Amy: You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you
   had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a
   couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it
   sounds, I thought that meant something.

   Sheldon: Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy,
   wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.

   Amy: Sure. Unless something better comes along.

   Sheldon: Do you want me to withdraw my application?

   Amy: What I want is for us to be planning our future together.

   Sheldon: And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because
   I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.

   Amy: We’re on the same planet.

   Sheldon: Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?

   Amy: Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?

   Sheldon: I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless
   environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I
   want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment,
   and fill out your application?

   Amy: Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet
   would be incredibly exciting.

   Sheldon: Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on
   Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We
   could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you
   talking about?

   Amy: You know, we could also be the first people to procreate
   on Mars.

   Sheldon: You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?

   Amy: Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would
   be Martians.

   Sheldon: They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool
   Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history.
   Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of
   Mars Attacks! come from?

   Amy: I guess we’ll have to make a new video together, as a
   couple.

   Sheldon: Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m
   gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.

   Scene: Emily’s bedroom.

   Raj: Thank you for forgiving me.

   Emily: That’s okay. At some point, we were bound to have our
   first fight.

   Raj: Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie
   crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just
   angry at myself.

   Emily: Can I ask you one thing?

   Raj: Of course. What?

   Emily: Did you look in my closet?

   Raj: No. Just the drawer.

   Emily: You promise you didn’t look in the closet?

   Raj: I promise. Why, what’s in there?

   Emily: Don’t worry about it. Good night.
