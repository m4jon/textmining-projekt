Series 2 Episode 20 – The Hofstadter Isotope

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!

   Leonard: Problem?

   Sheldon: This is Thai food.

   Howard: Here we go.

   Sheldon: We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on
   Thursday.

   Leonard: Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of
   every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.

   Sheldon: Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive
   system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything
   Can Happen Thursday.

   Howard: Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen
   Thursday is to get out of this rut we’ve been in lately.

   Sheldon: Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going
   to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it
   Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece,
   and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.

   Raj: I could go for some goat.

   Leonard: Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different
   tonight.

   Sheldon: All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.

   Raj: We went to the comic book store last night.

   Sheldon: Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book
   night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s
   Anything Can Happen Thursday.

   Leonard: Way to think outside but pressed right up against the
   box, Sheldon.

   Raj: So what are we going to do tonight?

   Howard: If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this
   great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies’ Night. Which
   means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking
   courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.

   Leonard: Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a
   bar are practically zero.

   Howard: Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?

   Sheldon: The one that estimates the odds of making contact with
   extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly
   restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars
   with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N
   equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?

   Howard: Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our
   chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number
   of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might
   find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.

   Raj: The Wolowitz Coefficient?

   Howard: Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the
   numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex
   partners within a 40-mile radius.

   Leonard: You’re joking.

   Howard: I’m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math
   or sex.

   Raj: Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s bounce, bitches.

   Leonard: You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s
   hit the clubs and meet hot women!

   Raj: Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We’re going to hit it
   and quit it.

   Leonard: Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book
   store.

   Raj: Also a good plan.

   Howard: Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we’re
   definitely going to a bar.

   Leonard: Oh, absolutely.

   Raj: You heard that, Ladies’ Night ladies? We’re eventually
   coming for you!

   Sheldon: Fascinating.

   Credits sequence.

   Penny: Oh hey, guys, where’re you headed?

   Sheldon: To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the
   comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the
   rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to
   take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen
   Thursday.

   Penny: You got me. While you’re there, could pick me up a few
   comics for my nephew’s birthday?

   Sheldon: I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble
   attempts at humour featuring talking babies and
   anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the
   optimistically named funny pages.

   Penny: Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my
   nephew’s birthday?

   Leonard: Sure. What does he like?

   Penny: I don’t know, he’s 13. Just pick out anything.

   Sheldon: Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can
   pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick
   out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick
   out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre
   requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.

   Penny: Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.

   Sheldon: Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular
   Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man
   2099?

   Penny: Leonard?

   Leonard: You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just
   come with us?

   Penny: Ugh, that’s what I was trying to avoid.

   Sheldon: Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Penny: Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody’s staring at
   me.

   Leonard: Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are
   of them.

   Penny: Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?

   Sheldon: A superb choice.

   Penny: Oh, great.

   Sheldon: Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and
   52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC
   multiverse.

   Penny: What’s a multiverse?

   Sheldon: Get her out of here.

   Leonard: Come on, I’ll help you pick something.

   Raj: That’s right. She’s with us. Guys like that are so
   pathetic.

   Howard: Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.

   Store clerk: Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?

   Leonard: Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some
   comic books.

   Stuart: Oh, really. Blink twice if you’re here against your
   will.

   Leonard: I think we’re fine, Stuart.

   Stuart: Let me know if you need anything.

   Penny: Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.

   Leonard: You mean for someone who’s into comic books?

   Penny: No, no, no, I just meant for… yeah.

   Leonard: Penny, just because people appreciate comic books
   doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went
   to the Rhode Island School of Design.

   Penny: What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt
   tucked into his sweatpants?

   Leonard: Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really
   help the point I’m trying to make.

   (Howard and Sheldon are looking through a rack of comic books.
   Each says “Got it” in turn as they look past each book until
   they eventually reach the one in the middle when they both
   together grab the book and shout “Need it!”)

   Howard: Let it go, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Why should I let it go? I saw it first.

   Howard: Yes, but I saw it from the front.

   Sheldon: A far less impressive feat.

   Howard: Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.

   Sheldon: I need it for my Robin collection.

   Howard: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?

   Sheldon: Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.

   Howard: You let go.

   Sheldon: No, you!

   Leonard: Problem?

   Sheldon: Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book.

   Howard: It’s my comic book!

   Sheldon: Leonard, we need a ruling.

   Leonard: Uh, cut it in half?

   Penny: Excuse me.

   Stuart: Hello again.

   Penny: Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a
   13-year-old boy?

   Stuart: A 13-year-old girl. But if you’re dead set on a comic
   book, try this.

   Penny: Oh, Hellblazer. What’s this about?

   Stuart: A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung
   cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.

   Penny: Well, if that doesn’t make me the favourite aunt, I
   don’t know what will. Is this me?

   Stuart: Depends. Do you like it?

   Penny: It’s really good.

   Stuart: Yes, that’s you.

   Penny: That’s so sweet, but what if I didn’t like it?

   Stuart: It’d still be you, but I’d feel like an idiot.

   Leonard: I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on
   Penny.

   Howard: I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!

   Sheldon: Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.

   Raj: Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny’s business over
   there?

   Leonard: Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our
   stuff and go.

   Penny: Okay, you’ve got my number, now, give me the picture.

   Stuart: You drive a hard bargain, but here.

   Penny: All right. So, um, just give me a call.

   Sheldon: So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen
   Thursday?

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has the comic book.

   Sheldon: Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard
   Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle
   of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series
   Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?

   Leonard: Apparently so.

   Sheldon: Are you ill?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re
   experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events
   involving Penny earlier this evening?

   Leonard: When did you pick up on that?

   Sheldon: A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle
   of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original
   Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like
   some advice?

   Leonard: Sure, why not?

   Sheldon: Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with
   an interactive comments section.

   Leonard: Gee, thanks a lot.

   Sheldon: Would you rather I offer my personal insight?

   Leonard: I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why
   Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically
   the same guy.

   Sheldon: Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic,
   self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off
   comic books.

   Leonard: You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on
   the Internet.

   Sheldon: My original point.

   Scene: The stairs.

   Sheldon: Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare
   of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way
   it was meant to be.

   Howard: Who’s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?

   Penny (coming out of apartment): Oh, hey guys.

   Leonard: Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.

   Stuart: Hey, guys.

   Howard: So what are you kids up to?

   Penny: Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that’s opening
   tonight.

   Leonard: And you guys are going together, great…

   Stuart: It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are
   you guys doing?

   Penny: It’s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage
   video games, right?

   Sheldon: Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have
   planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive
   text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.

   Penny: Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.

   Stuart: Yeah, see you guys.

   Howard: See you, Stuart.

   Leonard: Hey, Howard?

   Howard: Yes.

   Leonard: Take me to a bar with women.

   Howard: Really?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Howard: Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.

   Leonard: Why?

   Howard: Well, if I get lucky, I don’t want to be caught in my
   Aquaman briefs.

   Leonard (to Raj): Do you…? (Raj checks his underwear) Let’s go.

   Scene: A bar.

   Raj: May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?

   Howard: No, he may not.

   Raj: Why?

   Howard: I’m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper
   with a little umbrella.

   Raj: Fine. I’ll have a chocolate martini.

   Howard: Wrong again!

   Raj: Come on, you know I can’t talk to women unless I’m lit up
   like the Hindu festival of Diwali.

   Howard: Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you
   can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn’t
   have to because there are no women in them.

   Raj: Gotcha. I’ll have a Brandy Alexander.

   Howard: All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic
   Duo.

   Leonard: Should we talk to some of these women?

   Howard: It’s way too early in the night for that. See, first we
   let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go
   after the weak and the old and the lame.

   Leonard: That’s your system?

   Howard: That’s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a
   Seeing Eye dog, she’s mine.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Penny: Oh come on. I think it’s nice that Captain Sweatpants
   showed up to your art opening.

   Stuart: Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn’t touched all
   the cheese.

   Penny: Um, you know, it’s kind of early. Do you want to maybe
   come in for some coffee or something?

   Stuart: Oh, gee, it’s a little late for coffee, isn’t it?

   Penny: Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet.
   Come on, I think I have decaf.

   Sheldon: Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you
   have a moment?

   Stuart: Uh, yeah, I guess.

   Penny: Sheldon, we’re a little busy here, so…

   Sheldon: What are you doing?

   Stuart: We’re having coffee.

   Sheldon: Isn’t it a little late for coffee?

   Stuart: It’s okay. She thinks she has decaf.

   Penny: I’ll just go look for it.

   Stuart: What’s up?

   Sheldon: Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online
   debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.

   Stuart: Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What’s the
   topic?

   Sheldon: I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death
   proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the
   logical successor to the Bat Cowl.

   Stuart: Ooh, Sheldon, I’m afraid you couldn’t be more wrong.

   Sheldon: More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject
   to gradation.

   Stuart: Of course it is. It’s a little wrong to say a tomato is
   a vegetable, it’s very wrong to say it’s a suspension bridge.
   But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became
   Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the
   second Robin, Jason Todd.

   Sheldon: Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately
   provocative.

   Penny: I found the decaf!

   Stuart: Oh, great!

   Sheldon: Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.

   Scene: The bar.

   Raj: Barkeep! Alexander me.

   Leonard: How about those two?

   Howard: Nah, they’re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss
   would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.

   Leonard: What about the ones in the corner?

   Howard: Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the
   whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?

   Leonard: I think Blinky’s cute.

   Howard: You got it, sir.

   Leonard: Wait, so we just go over there?

   Howard: No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your
   mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my
   friend’s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out
   of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean,
   they’re laughing, we’re laughing, and then we get them up to
   about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we’re
   millionaires.

   Leonard: What else you got?

   Howard: Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend
   to be a ventriloquist dummy?

   Leonard: No.

   Howard: I can’t sit on your lap, you don’t know the routine.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Stuart: I’m sorry, but you’re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero
   Hour DC universe.

   Sheldon: Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of
   Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.

   Stuart: Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it
   doesn’t make you right.

   Sheldon: Au contraire.

   Stuart: Plus, you’re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis
   storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.

   Sheldon: I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.

   Stuart: Okay, look, Sheldon, it’s late and I’ve got to get some
   sleep.

   Sheldon: So, I win.

   Stuart: No, I’m tired.

   Sheldon: So, I win.

   Stuart: Fine. You win.

   Sheldon: Darn tootin’, I win.

   Stuart: Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?

   Sheldon: No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a
   rabid wolverine.

   Stuart: You know, I don’t think that was decaf.

   Scene: The bar.

   Howard: Wait, is this your card or isn’t it? Trust me, this was
   their card.

   Leonard: I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking
   about how you go to bars and meet women.

   Howard: I do, all the time.

   Leonard: Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night
   and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when
   your mom called.

   Howard: Wow, you’re just going to make me come out and say it,
   aren’t you?

   Leonard: Say what?

   Howard: You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better
   solo.

   Leonard: Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.

   Howard: Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t just tell a falcon when
   to hunt.

   Leonard: Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around
   it. Falconry.

   Howard: Shut up. Let’s just get Koothrappali and go. (They turn
   to see Raj with his tongue down the throat of a “larger lady”
   by the bar.) Lucky bastard. It’s got to be that stupid accent
   of his. (To a girl nearby) Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from
   Bombay. Okay, I’m stumped.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment. He wakes up clutched in the arms of the
   large lady. Tries to get away. She clutches him tighter. He
   shrugs and goes back to sleep.
