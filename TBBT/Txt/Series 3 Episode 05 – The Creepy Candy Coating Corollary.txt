Series 3 Episode 05 – The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and
   I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on
   that, sucka.

   Leonard: Okay, well, then I’ll just cut your vines with my ruby
   sword. That’s right, I did it. I cut ’em.

   Penny: Um, I have a question.

   Leonard: Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water
   sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.

   Howard: Unless you have the carrot power.

   Penny: Okay, I’ve got another question. When does this get fun?

   Howard: Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic
   Warlords of Ka-ah?

   Leonard: Just play a potion card.

   Penny: Which one?

   Sheldon: It doesn’t matter. You can’t possibly win.

   Leonard: Sheldon, don’t ruin the game.

   Penny: How could he ruin the game?

   Sheldon: Given the cards that have already been played, Penny
   can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only
   effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no
   more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the
   undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the
   jewel of Osiris.

   Leonard: See? Ruined.

   Penny: Sheldon, that is incredible.

   Sheldon: From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.

   Leonard: Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.

   Sheldon: Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory,
   as I’ve told you many times. Most recently last year during
   lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and
   complained it was dry.

   Howard: Well, I guess game’s over.

   Penny: Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.

   Leonard: Why?

   Penny: Because the last me I didn’t go, I ended up playing
   Mystic Warlords of Ka.

   Howard: Not Ka. Ka-ah.

   Penny: Ba-eye.

   Leonard: See ya. Still can’t believe she’s going out with me.

   Raj: Nobody can.

   Howard: That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.

   Leonard: What?

   Howard: You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a
   hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the
   other guy up with one of her girlfriends.

   Leonard: Yeah, I don’t remember that.

   Sheldon: June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the
   AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah.

   Howard: So you’ve been with Penny for like a month and a half
   now. Where’s my shorty, Morty?

   Leonard: Howard, you can’t hold me to that.

   Howard: Why not?

   Leonard: Because when I made that agreement, I didn’t think I’d
   ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.

   Raj: Hey, how come I wasn’t part of this deal?

   Sheldon: You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge
   in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.

   Raj: Oh, so that’s how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now
   I don’t get a hot girlfriend?

   Howard: Yeah, Raj, that’s how it works.

   Raj: Damn.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The university cafeteria.

   Leonard: Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, no.

   Leonard: But you have a whole bunch of ’em.

   Sheldon: Yes, I’ve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands,
   face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow,
   I’ll add a guest napkin, but I’m afraid there’s nothing I can
   do for you today. (Leonard steals a napkin) Good luck. That’s
   the face napkin.

   Howard: So, have you talked to Penny yet?

   Leonard: No, I haven’t.

   Howard: Why not?

   Leonard: Because I’ve been busy, because I haven’t figured out
   a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can’t stress how key
   this is, because I don’t want to.

   Howard: Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix
   me up.

   Leonard: It’s not that simple. What am I supposed to say?
   Penny, do you have any friends you’d like to never hear from
   again?

   Howard: Come on, I’m smart, I have good job and I have only
   three percent body fat.

   Raj: It’s true. I’ve seen him at the beach, he’s like a human
   chicken wing.

   Howard: Leonard, come on.

   Leonard: Fine. I’ll ask if she has a friend for you.

   Howard: A hot friend.

   Leonard: Right.

   Howard: And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space
   mountain before they’re 20.

   Leonard: I’ll see what I can do.

   Raj: Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?

   Sheldon: I’d imagine you heard any number of things today. When
   you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are
   you, Raj? Given that you’re wearing a new sweater-vest, you may
   have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less
   likely, nice sweater-vest.

   Raj: Why don’t I just tell you what I heard today.

   Sheldon: That would probably save us some time.

   Raj: Saturday night at the comic book store, they’re having a
   Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five
   hundred dollars. If we team up, we’d be unstoppable.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a
   game in which I find no challenge.

   Raj: What about the money?

   Sheldon: I have money.

   Raj: But this is other money.

   Sheldon: How does it different from the money I have?

   Raj: Half of it will be mine.

   Sheldon: Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?

   Raj: Leonard, help.

   Leonard: Are you kidding? I couldn’t even talk him into giving
   me one of his freakin’ napkins.

   Scene: Leonard and Penny are in bed.

   Penny: Wow, you really are a genius.

   Leonard: Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have
   you ever made a pact with someone?

   Penny: You mean, like a pinky swear?

   Leonard: Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.

   Penny: Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a
   pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?

   Leonard: Yeah, I’m familiar with Bert and Ernie.

   Penny: Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn’t speak
   again until middle school.

   Leonard: Over puppets?

   Penny: The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.

   Leonard: Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long
   time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves
   you.

   Penny: Okay, I don’t know where you’re going with this, but
   tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever
   have.

   Leonard: No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either
   of us ever got a girlfriend, we’d have her fix the other one up
   with one of her friends.

   Penny: And you thought a good time to bring this up be right
   after sex.

   Leonard: Well, I sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up
   before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on
   google, so…

   Penny: I’m not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.

   Leonard: Come on, it doesn’t have to be a good friend. And you
   know that deep down inside, Howard’s a really nice guy.

   Penny: The problem isn’t what’s on the inside. It’s the creepy
   candy coating.

   Leonard: Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to
   me?

   Penny: Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for
   anything. He just gave.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Sheldon: Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty
   and Veronica? Ugh.

   Stuart: Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine’s coming
   in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?

   Sheldon: Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to
   stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey
   from discovery to desire to possession.

   Stuart: All right, I won’t set one aside for you.

   Sheldon: But I must have it.

   Stuart: Okay, I’ll set one aside for you.

   Sheldon: Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things
   online. I come here for the personal service.

   Raj: Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic
   warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?

   Stuart: Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.

   Sheldon: Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign
   Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:

   The Next Generation is going to be participating in your
   tournament?

   Stuart: Oh, I’m sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to
   stumble onto that for yourself?

   Sheldon: You don’t understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil
   Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.

   Raj: Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with
   him while you’re playing in the tournament. Sign here.

   Sheldon: I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours
   by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing
   my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil
   Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley
   Crusher action figure.

   Raj: Ooh, it’ll be like a reunion then. Sign here.

   Sheldon: My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although
   advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that
   moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

   Raj: Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.

   Sheldon: It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton
   currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right
   between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the
   Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the
   street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.

   Raj: Okay, I get it, he’s a bad guy. Sign here.

   Sheldon: In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal
   wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.

   Raj: No doubt, sign here.

   Sheldon: From hell’s heart, I stab at thee.

   Stuart: All right, Raj, looks like you’re teamed up with die,
   Wil Wheaton, die.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Howard: So, tell me more about the future mother of my
   children.

   Penny: She’s adorable, Howard. I think you’ll like her.

   Howard: Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you
   mention the body fat?

   Penny: No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.

   Howard: Good, good.

   Penny: I just told her you’re an aerospace engineer, you speak
   five languages…

   Howard: Six if you count Klingon.

   Leonard: Girls don’t count Klingon, Howard. Right?

   Penny: Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy
   attachment to your mother.

   Howard: What?

   Penny: I’m kidding.

   Leonard: Another delightful surprise for her.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Raj: Sheldon, it’s your play. Sheldon.

   Sheldon: My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with
   a cursed mace. Game.

   Raj: Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up.
   Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up
   top!

   Sheldon: Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased
   you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom
   and round perdition’s flames!

   Raj: You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in
   next generation. It’s a totally different set of characters.

   Sheldon: Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?

   Raj: Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we
   beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round,
   we’ll face off for the championship.

   Sheldon: So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry
   and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.

   Raj: Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It’s really
   lame.

   Sheldon: Silence!

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Howard: So, Penny tells me you’re working as a waitress to put
   yourself through grad school. That’s pretty great, what are you
   studying?

   Bernadette: Microbiology.

   Howard: Oh, cool. So you could study me.

   Bernadette: I don’t understand.

   Howard: Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.

   Bernadette: I know, I’m studying it.

   Howard: And I said you could study me ’cause I’m a tiny living
   thing. It’s a joke.

   Bernadette: Are you sure?

   Howard: Do you like science-fiction?

   Bernadette: No.

   Howard: Role-playing games?

   Bernadette: Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?

   Howard: Either.

   Bernadette: No.

   Leonard: Gonna be a long night.

   Penny: Yeah, well, it’s your fault.

   Leonard: I had to ask. You didn’t have to say yes.

   Howard: You like magic?

   Bernadette: Not really.

   Howard: Okay.

   Leonard: Long, long night.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Sheldon: I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic
   frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord,
   then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad,
   game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr
   jablu’DI’ reH QaQqu’ nay’

   Wil Wheaton: Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best
   served cold in Klingon?

   Stuart: I believe so.

   Wil Wheaton: What is wrong with him?

   Stuart: Everyone has a different theory.

   Scene: A restaurant.

   Howard: How about computers? Do you like computers?

   Bernadette: I use them. I don’t like them.

   Howard: Okay… Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?

   Bernadette: A puppy once bit my face.

   Howard: Of course it did.

   Leonard: How about that? Einstein was wrong.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: Approaching the speed of light doesn’t slow down time.
   Approaching them does.

   Howard (phone rings): Excuse me. Oh, damn. It’s my mother.

   Bernadette: Are you going to answer it?

   Howard: I’m torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn’t
   want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to
   voicemail, I could play it over and over.

   Bernadette: I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.

   Howard: Not as crazy as my mother makes me.

   Bernadette: Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at
   work to see if you’ve had a healthy lunch?

   Howard: My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy
   bowel movement.

   Bernadette: Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you
   in the morning like you’re nine years old?

   Howard: You live with your mother?

   Bernadette: No. That’s the sad part.

   Howard: Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me
   wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn’t pick up a
   disease from the other children.

   Bernadette: That’s nothing. I couldn’t ride a bicycle ’cause my
   mother was afraid I’d hit a bump and lose my virginity.

   Howard: Oh, wow. You didn’t, did you?

   Bernadette: Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.

   Howard: Corolla!

   Bernadette: Oh!

   Howard: More wine?

   Bernadette: I’d love some.

   Howard: Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house
   sometime.

   Bernadette: Why?

   Howard: A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that
   might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I’ve been
   hoping for.

   Bernadette: Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my
   house wearing a yarmulke.

   Howard: It’s a date.

   Penny: Am I a matchmaker or what?

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Raj: Lava serpent.

   Stuart: Nest of snakes.

   Wil Wheaton: Underworld guardian.

   Sheldon: Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.

   Wil Wheaton: Invisibility spell.

   Sheldon: Luminescence spell.

   Wil Wheaton: Water nymph.

   Sheldon: Fire demon.

   Wil Wheaton: Two-headed tiger.

   Sheldon: Three-headed lion.

   Wil Wheaton: Sulphur.

   Sheldon: Brimstone.

   Raj: Problem, Wil Wheaton?

   Wil Wheaton: Hang on.

   Sheldon: You’re holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock
   and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an
   air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to
   play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the
   game.

   Wil Wheaton: I think he’s got me.

   Sheldon: The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi.
   Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice
   violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a
   moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual
   Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton
   decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my
   action figure.

   Wil Wheaton: What?

   Sheldon: You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.

   Wil Wheaton: You went to the ’95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my
   grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.

   Sheldon: Your mee-maw died? That’s terrible.

   Wil Wheaton: Yeah, it was. But I’m really sorry that I
   disappointed you.

   Sheldon: No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw,
   I’d be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that
   statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.

   Wil Wheaton: It’s special relationship, isn’t it, between a boy
   and his grandmother?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes.

   Raj: Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on,
   Sheldon, finish him off!

   Wil Wheaton: It’s okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it.
   Potion of Zancor.

   Raj: What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell’s
   heart, stab at him!

   Sheldon: I can’t.

   Raj: Sure you can. Do it! Do it!

   Sheldon: No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who
   destroyed my dreams. But I can’t defeat Wil Wheaton, the man
   who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.

   Raj: No! Not enchanted bunny!

   Wil Wheaton: I call my mee-maw nana. And she’s going be very
   happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny.
   Game over, moon pie.

   Sheldon: I… I… I don’t understand. Your grandmother’s alive?

   Wil Wheaton: Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let’s get
   our prize money.

   Stuart: That was fun.

   Sheldon (while camera zooms out from Sheldon to above planet in
   a pastiche of the famous Wrath of Khan scene): Wheaton!
   Wheaton! Wheaton!
