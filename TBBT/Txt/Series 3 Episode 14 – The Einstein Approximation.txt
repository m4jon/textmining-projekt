Series 3 Episode 14 – The Einstein Approximation

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is stood in the middle of the
   room. His whiteboard is behind him. Every few moments he turns
   round suddently.

   Penny: Whatcha doing?

   Sheldon: I’m attempting to view my work as a fleeting
   peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my
   brain.

   Penny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You’ve been up
   all night?

   Sheldon: Is it morning?

   Penny: Yes.

   Sheldon: Then I’ve been up all night.

   Penny: And you’re stuck?

   Sheldon: Why else would a person try to engage their superior
   colliculus?

   Penny: Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can’t help you till I’ve had my
   coffee.

   Leonard: Penny, I told you if you don’t put him in his crate at
   night he just runs around the apartment.

   Penny: What is he doing now?

   Leonard: Mmm, he’s either isolating the terms of his formula
   and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator
   that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.

   Sheldon: Captain Hook’s hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an
   alligator. If you’re going to mock me, at least get your facts
   straight.

   Leonard: Aye, aye, Captain.

   Sheldon: I can’t see it! It just won’t coalesce.

   Leonard: Maybe you need a fresh start.

   Sheldon: You’re right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws
   it out. Picks up a new one) It’s a great idea, Leonard. Thank
   you.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Sheldon: Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have
   no mass…

   Howard: How long has he been stuck?

   Leonard: Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29
   years.

   Sheldon: Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of
   a hexagon is 120 degrees.

   Howard: Have you tried rebooting him?

   Leonard: No, I think it’s a firmware problem.

   Raj (arriving): Hey, it’s Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller
   Rink in Glendale tonight. Who’s up for getting down?

   Howard: Oh, that’s perfect. Bernadette’s been hocking me to
   take her roller skating.

   Leonard: I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could
   double.

   Howard: What could be better? We’re in.

   Raj: Great. It’s not like I brought it up because I wanted to
   go.

   Howard: You can come with us.

   Raj: No, it’s okay. I don’t have to go. I’m happy just to guide
   you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I’m a
   walking brown Yelp.com.

   Sheldon: Structure, constant structure. One atom…

   Howard: Boy, he’s really gone, isn’t he?

   Leonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as
   deodorant.

   Howard: I thought I smelled popcorn.

   Sheldon: Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the
   pathways, hexagonal, it’s always hexagonal…

   Leonard: I haven’t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure
   out the third Matrix movie.

   Raj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate): Hey,
   those are my lima beans!

   Sheldon: Not lima beans, carbon atoms.

   Raj: But if I don’t eat my lima beans, I can’t have my cookie.

   Leonard: Here, you want my peas?

   Sheldon: Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.

   Howard: Want my corn?

   Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?

   Leonard: So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat
   first?

   Howard: Good. P.F. Chang’s? My mom has coupons.

   Leonard: Great. Your mom’s not coming, right?

   Howard: Not this time, I promise.

   Raj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and
   I’m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I
   hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.

   Sheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.

   Raj: Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Bernadette: Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?

   Penny: Not recently.

   Bernadette: I don’t know which was lamer, their roller-skating
   or their disco dancing.

   Penny: For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with
   them.

   Leonard: You had some nice moves out there, Howard.

   Howard: Thanks. You, too.

   Leonard: Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?

   Howard: Not really. I was in my boogie zone.

   Bernadette: When Howard tried to do the splits…

   Penny: Shh.

   Leonard: Sorry. I’m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my
   coccyx.

   Penny: Oh, poor baby.

   Leonard: Don’t tell Koothrappali. After you.

   Penny: Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. (Steps on marbles
   which are all over the floor, screams and falls)

   Leonard: Oh, my God! Are you… (falls as well)

   Sheldon: Good Lord! You’re ruining everything!

   Penny: Oh, damn.

   Leonard: Are you okay?

   Penny: Do I look okay?

   Leonard: Don’t bark at me. I fell, too.

   Penny: Oh, you’ve been falling all night. You’re used to it.

   Howard: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?

   Sheldon: The same thing I’ve been doing for three days. Trying
   to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when
   travelling through a graphene sheet.

   Bernadette: With marbles?

   Sheldon: Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn’t
   I?

   Bernadette: Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?

   Sheldon: I don’t know, two, three days. Not important. I don’t
   need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this
   swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.

   Penny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?

   Leonard: No, that’s a crazy thing.

   Bernadette: Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors
   when we don’t get enough REM sleep?

   Sheldon: They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and
   norepinephrine.

   Bernadette: Which leads to…?

   Sheldon: Impaired cognitive function.

   Bernadette: Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go
   to bed.

   Sheldon: But I don’t want to go to bed.

   Bernadette: I’m going to count to three. One…

   Sheldon: Oh, all right.

   Leonard: That was amazing how you handled him.

   Bernadette: I know how to deal with stubborn children. My
   mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom.

   Penny: Leonard, you’re… you’re giggling in your sleep.

   Leonard: It’s not me, it’s my new ringtone. The Joker from
   Batman.

   Penny: Well, it creeps me out.

   Leonard: Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.

   Penny: Just answer the phone.

   Leonard: Hello. Yeah, I’m Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he’s
   my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I’ll
   be right there.

   Penny: What happened?

   Leonard: Sheldon’s escaped and is terrorizing the village.

   Penny: Okay. Have fun.

   Scene: A children’s play area.

   Leonard: Hi. I’m Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?

   Security Guard: Ball pit.

   Leonard: Thanks for not calling the cops.

   Security Guard: Oh, hey, it’s no big deal. My sister’s got a
   kid who’s special.

   Leonard: Yeah, well, he’s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you
   doing?

   Sheldon: Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn’t visualize it.
   Needed bigger carbon atoms.

   Leonard: Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?

   Sheldon: Back door has a five-pin tumbler system,
   single-circuit alarm. Child’s play. You can start sorting
   protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.

   Leonard: No, I don’t think so. We need to go home now.

   Sheldon: But I’m still working.

   Leonard: If you don’t come out of there, I’m going to have to
   drag you out.

   Sheldon: You can try, but you’ll never catch me. (He disappears
   under the balls)

   Leonard: For God’s sakes. Sheldon, come here!

   Sheldon (popping his head up): Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in
   another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again)
   Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon is standing over their bed.
   He knocks on the wall.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock,
   knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.

   Leonard (Waking up as Penny screams): What! What, what, what?

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: I have good news.

   Leonard: And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the
   middle of the night?

   Sheldon: Your cell phone was off.

   Leonard: Because we didn’t want to be disturbed.

   Sheldon: And that didn’t work out, did it?

   Penny: Sheldon, what do you want?

   Sheldon: I came to tell you I’ve got the answer.

   Leonard: Really? You figured out the graphene problem?

   Sheldon: No, no, I’m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I
   figured out how to figure it out.

   Penny: Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could
   handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We’re going to have to
   break up.

   Leonard: What are you talking about?

   Penny (as Sheldon sits on the bed): Oh.

   Sheldon: Einstein.

   Leonard: Yeah, I’m going to need a little more.

   Sheldon: Albert Einstein.

   Leonard: Keep going.

   Sheldon: When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity,
   he was working at the patent office.

   Leonard: So, you’re going to go work at the patent office?

   Sheldon: Don’t be absurd. That’s in Washington. You know I
   could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a
   wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I’m going to find a similarly
   menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine
   task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the
   background on my problem.

   Leonard: Sounds like a great plan.

   Sheldon: Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently
   menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.

   Leonard: Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the
   way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that
   your snoring seems to be worse when you’re on your back.

   Penny: Leonard doesn’t snore.

   Sheldon: No, I wasn’t talking to Leonard.

   Leonard: Told you.

   Scene: An employment office

   Employment Office Assistant: So, Mr. Cooper, you’re looking for
   a job.

   Sheldon: A menial job. Like yours.

   Assistant: Why, thank you for noticing. I’m Menial Employee of
   the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?

   Sheldon: I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of
   the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect
   monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they
   dropped down and became one with the dust through which they
   trudged. Do you have anything like that?

   Assistant: No.

   Sheldon: Shouldn’t you check your database?

   Assistant (clicks her keyboard a few times): No.

   Sheldon: You didn’t really type.

   Assistant: I didn’t really have to. So, how about construction?

   Sheldon: Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out
   of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched
   precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.

   Assistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing
   project in Rosemead.

   Sheldon: I could do that.

   Assistant: Good.

   Sheldon: One question.

   Assistant: Yes?

   Sheldon: What’s sheetrock?

   Assistant: Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?

   Sheldon: That seems acceptable.

   Assistant: Do you have your own car?

   Sheldon: I don’t drive.

   Assistant: Of course you don’t. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you
   a question. What was your last job?

   Sheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech,
   focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory.

   Assistant: I see. Just give me a second. Security!

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.

   Penny: Okay, I’ll get those drinks started for you.

   Sheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray): Behind
   you.

   Penny: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?

   Sheldon: I’m trying to get these tables cleared. We’re slammed.

   Penny: No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?

   Sheldon: A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the
   most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three
   answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store
   genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don’t like touching
   other people’s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the
   devaluation of the word genius, here I am.

   Penny: You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just
   like that?

   Sheldon: Oh, heavens, no. Since I don’t need to be paid, I
   didn’t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray,
   and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of
   your way.

   Penny: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.

   Sheldon: Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany
   regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping
   congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their
   check.

   Bernadette: Thanks, Sheldon.

   Penny: Sheldon, wait, this isn’t even what I do. I’m a
   waitress, not a busboy.

   Sheldon: You’re right. That is more menial. Hello, I’m Sheldon.
   I’ll be your server today. I don’t recommend the salmon. I saw
   it in the kitchen.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Sheldon: All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish
   dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish
   and chips. Now, here’s your tartar sauce. I also brought you
   salsa. It’s a little unconventional, but I think you’ll like
   it. It’s zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese,
   no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose
   intolerance. Bon appétit.

   Leonard: Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Leonard: Double guacamole?

   Sheldon: Of course.

   Leonard: No cilantro?

   Sheldon: Nope.

   Leonard: Lettuce shredded, not chopped?

   Sheldon: Yep.

   Leonard: You understand why I’m doing this to you?

   Sheldon: I do.

   Leonard: That’ll be all. That was fun.

   Raj: How long can he keep this up?

   Leonard: I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down,
   bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog
   groomer.

   Raj: He never went back to the university?

   Leonard: Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg’s shih tzu.

   Raj: Sheesh.

   Howard: I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.

   Raj: But he’s afraid of dogs.

   Leonard: Yeah, that’s the only thing wrong with that plan.

   Penny: Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped.
   What’s this?

   Leonard: Sheldon took our order.

   Penny: Sheldon doesn’t work here.

   Leonard: Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to
   think you didn’t either.

   Sheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps): Is that really
   necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture.
   The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I’ve
   been looking at it all wrong. I can’t consider the electrons as
   particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It’s a
   wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.

   Penny: Sheldon, where are you going? Aren’t you going to clean
   this up?

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. I don’t work here.

   Scene: The roller disco.

   Howard: Happy now?

   Raj: I’m on a cloud. Swing me. (Howard swings Raj several
   times.)

   Scene: The ball pit, presumably earlier.

   Leonard: Sheldon, come here.

   (Sheldon once again keeps popping up his head and shouting
   “Bazinga” as Leonard flails around trying to catch him.)
