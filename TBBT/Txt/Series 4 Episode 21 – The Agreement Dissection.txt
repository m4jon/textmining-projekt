Series 4 Episode 21 – The Agreement Dissection

   Scene: The bathroom

   Sheldon: Leonard, are you in the shower?

   Leonard: I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.

   Sheldon: I asked if you were in the shower, but that’s moot
   now.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.

   Leonard: I can’t hear you, I’m in the shower.

   Sheldon: I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.

   Leonard: What kind of emergency?

   Sheldon: Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce
   bladder.

   Leonard: You might not want to do that.

   Sheldon: I assure you I do.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I’m not alone in here.

   Sheldon: What?

   Priya: Hello, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: What are you doing in there? She can’t be in here.

   Leonard: We were in here first, you can’t be in here.

   Sheldon: According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine,
   subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the
   event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a
   very majeure force.

   Sheldon: Come on, you can’t wait two minutes?

   Priya: Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.

   Scene: Penny’s door.


   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Move. Move. Move!

   Credits sequence.


   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged
   with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive
   reading of the charges?

   Leonard: Yeah, fine.

   Priya: Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the
   charges.

   Leonard: Oh. Cool. I’ve got a lawyer. And I’ve seen her naked.

   Priya: Proceed.

   Sheldon: Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day
   of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice
   aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of
   emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the
   second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the
   shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by
   water-soluble aliens.

   Priya: Can I see the roommate agreement?

   Sheldon: Um, it’s fairly technical.

   Priya: I think I can handle it.

   Leonard: Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to
   practice law in three countries. And your face.

   Priya: All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn’t look
   like you have much of a case, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Do so, do so.

   Priya: Oh, I’m afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to
   enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as
   to what constitutes an emergency.

   Sheldon: Oh, that’s ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is
   self-explanatory.

   Priya: Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he
   barge in while you were showering?

   Sheldon: Irrelevant. Leonard doesn’t trim his nose hair. He
   thinks because he’s short nobody can see up there.

   Priya: My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity
   in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this
   case, Leonard. So much for count one.

   Sheldon: But…

   Priya: There’s no buts, Sheldon, that’s how the law works.

   Leonard: Schooled!

   Priya: As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J.
   When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be
   taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this
   supercedes the occupancy issue.

   Leonard: Superceded!

   Sheldon: This isn’t over.

   Leonard: No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second
   best thing that’s happened today.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most
   delightfully cruel thing we’ve done to Sheldon since we left
   that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.

   Priya: Seriously?

   Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice): I wish to discuss your
   theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randy’s Donut by the
   airport at 2:00 a.m.

   Sheldon: What is that you’re eating? Tonight is pizza night.

   Leonard: I’d like to refer that to my attorney.

   Priya: According to what I see here, Thursday nights are
   Franconi’s pizza night.

   Sheldon: Yes, and when Franconi’s went out of business, we
   switched to Graziano’s.

   Howard: That’s interesting. Can you just switch restaurants
   like that, Priya?

   Priya: A good question, Howard. Turns out you can’t. According
   to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new
   takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day
   comment period. Were those criteria met?

   Sheldon: No.

   All: Opa!

   Sheldon: This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.

   Leonard: Not as much as you.

   Sheldon: Fine. I’m nothing if not adaptable.

   Leonard: I got you the lamb kabob.

   Sheldon: Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn’t
   that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And
   what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science,
   democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like
   sweat.

   Scene: Penny’s door.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?

   Penny: Hey. What’s up?

   Sheldon: The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb.
   Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment.
   Order one.

   Penny: Oh, I’m sorry, honey, I’m meeting Amy and Bernadette for
   dinner. But you’re welcome to tag along.

   Sheldon: A girls night? Oh, I don’t know if I’m up for an
   evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.

   Penny: Okay, suit yourself. We’ll probably be trashing Priya a
   little.

   Sheldon: Shotgun.

   Scene: A bar.

   Penny: Okay, I’d like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls
   night out.

   Amy: Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.

   Bernadette: Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to
   be dragons.

   Sheldon: Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you
   not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having
   a good time?

   Amy: Why did you bring him? He’s harshing my buzz.

   Penny: I felt sorry for him. Priya’s giving him a hard time.

   Bernadette: Ooh, the Priya bashing’s starting early. Yay! Okay,
   what’s up with those pantsuits?

   Amy: I need some context.

   Penny: Pantsuits suck.

   Amy: And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing
   them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.

   Scene: The same, later.

   Bernadette: Whee-ee-ee!

   Amy: You smell like baby powder.

   Sheldon: It’s talc. But as that’s a primary ingredient of baby
   powder, I understand your confusion.

   Amy: Oh, I’m not confused at all. You’re like a sexy toddler.

   Sheldon: I don’t know how to process that.

   Bernadette: I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree.
   K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.

   Penny: That’s too many S’s for kissing.

   Bernadette: Not if they’re doing it for a long time.

   Penny: Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?

   Sheldon: Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no.
   But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and
   had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who
   passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas
   card from her, signed with far too many X’s and O’s.

   Bernadette: That doesn’t count. Aren’t you even a little
   curious?

   Penny: Yeah, you’re a scientist, where is the curiosity?

   Amy: I’m available for experimentation.

   Sheldon: Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is
   to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112
   postural muscles.

   Amy: Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie (kisses
   Penny).

   Sheldon: I’m certainly glad no one said they were curious about
   Aztec human sacrifice.

   Penny: Hey, I know, let’s take Sheldon dancing.

   Bernadette: Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he
   looks like a spider on a hot plate.

   Sheldon: No, thank you, but for the record, I’m an excellent
   dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.

   Amy: Really?

   Sheldon: I don’t see why that’s surprising. I excel at so many
   things. You’ve had my sourdough bread.

   Penny: Did you take dance lessons?

   Sheldon: Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children
   are forced through a process called cotillion, which
   indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills
   needed to function in 18th century Vienna.

   Penny: Oh, we are so taking you dancing.

   Sheldon: No, you most certainly are not.

   Bernadette: Well, what does your cotillion training say is
   expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort
   them to a dance soiree?

   Sheldon: I saved a nun’s life. Why am I being punished?

   Scene: A taxi.


   Penny: Take us to a place we can waltz.

   Taxi driver: Where you can what?

   Sheldon: Waltz. It’s a social dance from Austria, choreographed
   to a three-four time signature. (Sings Blue Danube. The taxi
   driver says something into radio in Korean. The word “waltz” is
   included. Dispatcher replies also in Korean. Taxi driver sings
   Blue Danube. Dispatcher says “oh, waltz!” They speak Korean
   some more. )

   Taxi Driver: Here we go.

   Amy (singing): I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my
   boyfriend don’t mind it.

   Sheldon: What happened to you?

   Scene: A Korean ballroom dancing club. Sheldon and Amy are
   dancing.

   Penny: Shake it baby, shake it!

   Bernadette: Muy caliente, Sheldon!

   Elderly Korean Gentleman: Care to dance?

   Bernadette: Oh, I’m sorry, I’m engaged.

   Korean: How about you?

   Penny: Oh, what the hell. Ooh!

   Scene: Outside Amy’s apartment.

   Amy: How come if we’re the smart people, we don’t do this every
   night?

   Sheldon: What’s 16 times 14?

   Amy: My burps taste like cranberry juice.

   Sheldon: And there’s your answer.

   Amy: Would you like to come in for a nightcap?

   Sheldon: If you’re referring to the beverage, you know I don’t
   drink. If you’re referring to the hat you don while wearing a
   nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.

   Amy: I have yoo-hoo.

   Sheldon: It’s hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally
   beckons.

   Amy: Make yourself comfortable.

   Sheldon: Thank you. Is someone smoking?

   Amy: Oh, that’s just Ricky.

   Sheldon: You own a smoking monkey?

   Amy: Don’t be silly. He’s one of the animals in my department’s
   nicotine addiction study.

   Sheldon: What’s he doing here?

   Amy: I’m giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him
   hang out and watch cable.

   Sheldon: Remarkable. Aren’t you worried about secondhand smoke?

   Amy: A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while
   I’m sleeping.

   Sheldon: is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?

   Amy: Yeah. He’s kind of an ass.

   Sheldon: Thank you. May I share something with you that’s
   troubling me?

   Amy: Of course. What’s rattling around that big bulbous brain
   of yours?

   Sheldon: Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement
   with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable
   for me.

   Amy: And you want me to kill her? Done.

   Sheldon: No, of course not.

   Amy: I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a
   poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love
   monkeys.

   Sheldon: I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is
   that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart
   Amy now.

   Amy: Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence
   might be the very thing causing your dilemma?

   Sheldon: No.

   Amy: What do you think Ricky over here would do if an
   interloper encroached on his territory?

   Sheldon: Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their
   dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile
   display. That’s a little outside my comfort zone.

   Amy: You’re being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly
   surrender to the rules, and neither should you.

   Sheldon: Are you suggesting I play dirty?

   Amy: Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our
   next order of business. (Kisses him)

   Sheldon: Fascinating.

   Amy: I hope you don’t take what I’m about to do as a comment on
   what we just did. (Runs to bathroom and vomits)

   Sheldon (to Ricky): Who’s to say you shouldn’t be dissecting
   our brains? You really are an ass.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Morning, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh, good, you’re up. I’ve written a new and improved
   roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I’d like you to
   sign it.

   Leonard: Why would I want to do that?

   Sheldon: Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to
   the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in
   the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?

   Leonard: Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence
   and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both
   unless he gave in?

   Sheldon: Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
   Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.

   Female Voice: Self-destruct sequence activated.

   Leonard: What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?

   Sheldon: That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is
   here.

   Priya: So what happens when it counts down?

   Sheldon: Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41
   seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in
   India saying that you’re in a secret relationship with the
   whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.

   Priya: Oh, my God.

   Leonard: What’s the big deal?

   Priya: Trust me, it’s a big deal.

   Leonard: They’re gonna find out about me eventually, right?

   Priya: Yeah, of course, just not today.

   Sheldon: 20 seconds.

   Leonard: Are you ashamed of me?

   Priya: Of course not.

   Leonard: Then why can’t we tell your parents?

   Priya: Please, don’t push this.

   Sheldon: He does that all the time, doesn’t he? 15.

   Priya: Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.

   Leonard: No, he’s bluffing.

   Sheldon: I never bluff. Ten.

   Leonard: It’s blackmail!

   Sheldon: Nine.

   Priya: We give up.

   Sheldon: Eight.

   Leonard: This is ridiculous. (Pulls out plug)

   Sheldon: It’s a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do
   you see in him?

   Priya: Give him what he wants or we’re done.

   Sheldon: Three.

   Leonard: Really?

   Sheldon: Two.

   Leonard: Okay, I’ll sign it!

   Female Voice: Self-destruct sequence aborted.

   Sheldon: You may have gone to Cambridge, but I’m an honorary
   graduate of Starfleet academy.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is at his laptop.

   Sheldon: Good morning, Amy.

   Amy: It most assuredly is not.

   Sheldon: Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and
   shame?

   Amy: Yes. I also found a Korean man’s business card tucked into
   my cleavage. What happened last night?

   Sheldon: Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of
   every vodka bottle.

   Amy: Sheldon?

   Sheldon: All right. Last night you gave me some excellent
   advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and
   then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you
   passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under
   your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time
   because it was driving me crazy, and I left.

   Amy: Okay. Don’t really know where we go from here.

   Sheldon: I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a
   crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree
   it worked.

   Amy: Terrific. Thank you. (Noise of Ricky in background) They
   were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a
   temperamental little primate.

   Leonard (off): Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!

   Sheldon: You’re preaching to the choir, sister.
