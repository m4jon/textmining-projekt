Series 5 Episode 06 – The Rhinitis Revelation

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon’s mother is visiting.

   Leonard: So what kind of cruise is this you’re going on?

   Mrs Cooper: It’s called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian
   Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I
   do wish you’d come with me, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that
   your God can work miracles.

   Mrs Cooper: You’re missing out. It’s gonna be wall-to-wall fun.
   It’s all themed. There’s Jonah and the Whale Watching,
   all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite,
   Gunning with God.

   Leonard: What’s Gunning with God? I’m afraid to ask.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on
   a clay pigeon, they fire ’em up in the air, and you pulverize
   them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord’s forgiveness.

   Sheldon: Frankly, Mom, I’m encouraged to see how advanced your
   group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without
   fear of falling off the edge.

   Mrs Cooper: For example, if Shelly was aboard, he’d write
   “smart mouth” on his pigeon, and then bam!

   Sheldon: The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom,
   according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun
   begins with fried chicken.

   Mrs Cooper: Sounds delicious.

   Sheldon: Good, ’cause I got you everything you need to make it.
   You are in for a treat. My mother’s fried chicken is why we had
   to buy my dad the extra large coffin.

   Leonard: Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn’t want
   to cook.

   Sheldon: Of course she does. Making me food is her way of
   saying I love you. Making me food when she’s too tired to cook
   is her way of saying I really love you.

   Mrs Cooper: Actually, I wouldn’t mind going out for a bite,
   Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Won’t that spoil our appetites for the chicken you’re
   going to make me?

   Leonard: All right, that settles it, we’re going out. Do you
   like sushi? There’s a great little place down the street.

   Mrs Cooper: I’ve never had it, but there’s no harm in trying
   something new.

   Sheldon: There’s a lot of harm in trying something new. That’s
   why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you’re talking like a crazy person.

   Mrs Cooper: Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says
   he’s fine.

   Sheldon: Told you.

   Mrs Cooper: Although, I do regret not following up with that
   specialist in Houston.

   Credits Sequence.

   Scene: A sushi bar.

   All: Irasshaimase!

   Sheldon: Stop yelling! I’m not happy about this.

   Leonard: What’s the last thing you were ever happy about?

   Sheldon: The prospect of fried chicken.

   Mrs Cooper: This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route
   Four serves sushi, but it’s just cut up fish sticks and a side
   of Uncle Ben’s. They put it on the menu in those kung fu
   letters, but that don’t make it sushi.

   Leonard: Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, I thought the one we couldn’t say was ching
   chong.

   Leonard: Yeah, yeah, that, too.

   Mrs Cooper: So, Shelly, what’s up with you and your friend Amy,
   if you don’t mind a mother prying a bit?

   Sheldon: Well, there’s actually big news on the Amy front.
   She’s been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower
   animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on
   cocaine.

   Mrs Cooper: Do you have any idea what’s going on with those
   two?

   Leonard: It’s kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there’s
   something there, maybe there isn’t. We’ll probably never know.
   But sometimes it’s fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.

   Mrs Cooper: How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear
   you’re in some sort of a long distance situation?

   Leonard: Uh, yeah, it’s Raj’s sister. It’s kind of tough. She’s
   in India. Also, her parents aren’t happy she’s dating someone
   white.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, that’s a funny turn, isn’t it? You never think
   about it going the other way. Well, you can’t force things. You
   need to figure out if you’re in a relationship or if you’re
   just calling it one. It’s like they say, a cat can have kittens
   in the oven but that don’t make ’em biscuits.

   Sheldon: And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a
   chicken to Crisco, but you can’tmake your mother fry it.

   Mrs Cooper: Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken,
   I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.

   Leonard: Please pester her. Please, for me.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Leonard: So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?

   Mrs Cooper: It was good. The only thing that would have made it
   better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is
   your landlord going to fix the elevator?

   Sheldon: I don’t know. Lately we’ve been talking about
   converting it into a missile silo.

   Leonard: Your son seems to think we need to launch a
   pre-emptive strike on Burbank.

   Sheldon: Get them before they get us.

   Raj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer): Hey,
   look who decided to show up.

   Leonard: Raj, what are you doing?

   Raj: I couldn’t find you guys so I bought six new friends.
   Three, sadly, are dead.

   Sheldon: Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.

   Raj: Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.

   Mrs Cooper: Well, it’s so nice to see you, too. I thought it
   was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.

   Leonard: We don’t say that, either. I’ll make you a list.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj,
   what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?

   Raj: Nothing, I’m fine.

   Mrs Cooper: Are ya?

   Raj: No. (Bursts into tears)

   Mrs Cooper: That’s better. Now tell me what’s bothering you.

   Raj: I’m so lonely.

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It’s a tragic human
   condition. Now, Raj, if you’ll excuse my mother, she’s about to
   make a pecan pie that’ll be so good I’ll almost forget how she
   blew it with the fried chicken.

   Mrs Cooper: Sheldon, your friend is hurtin’. What do we do when
   someone’s hurtin’?

   Sheldon: Offer them a hot beverage.

   Mrs Cooper: And when they’re drunk as a skunk, what beverage do
   we offer?

   Sheldon: Coffee.

   Mrs Cooper: And what do we do it with? (Sheldon fixes a large
   false smile.) Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you
   can’t find someone, but there’s a lock for every key. Back
   home, there’s a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl.
   Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she’d never find a
   man, then one day, wouldn’t ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come
   to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world
   with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful
   mixed-race babies.

   Raj: I didn’t get a lot of that because of your accent, but the
   general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.

   Sheldon: I’m not going to get my pecan pie, am I?

   Leonard: You want some Oreos?

   Sheldon: Double Stuf?

   Leonard: No, regular.

   Sheldon: Nice. Kick a man when he’s down.

   Scene: The laundry room.

   Sheldon: I’m glad we’re finally getting to do something
   together, just the two of us.

   Mrs Cooper: Sure. One thing you really miss when you’re on
   vacation is laundry.

   Sheldon: Careful, you’re using too much Downey. You know if my
   clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.

   Mrs Cooper: Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry,
   you next to me criticizing.

   Sheldon: It is nice, isn’t it?

   Penny (arriving): Mrs. Cooper. Hi!

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, hello, darlin’.

   Penny: Sheldon, you didn’t tell me your mom was coming.

   Sheldon: It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet
   season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads
   to cancer scare.

   Mrs Cooper: So, how’ve you been?

   Penny: Good, good.

   Mrs Cooper: I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are
   you doing with all that?

   Penny: Oh, fine. You know, it’s been a while. I’m getting back
   out there.

   Mrs Cooper: Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are
   you wearing this? (Holds up a skimpy top)

   Penny: Well, it’s super cute on. That top has paid for itself
   in free drinks like ten times what it cost.

   Sheldon: Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in
   promiscuity futures.

   Mrs Cooper: Hon, you think maybe the reason why you’re having
   trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you’re
   letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?

   Penny: Oh, they don’t always get to ride the roller coaster.
   Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I’m going out
   tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I’m
   going to wear?

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, not crazy at all. And don’t beat yourself up.
   When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a
   bottle of strawberry wine.

   Sheldon: Now that will not be in this week’s e-mail blast.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space
   Station.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever
   want to live there eternally, I’ve got a good book you could
   read.

   Howard: Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special
   every year, so I get the gist.

   Mrs Cooper: I bet your mom is really proud of you.

   Howard: Nope. She says if I don’t back out she’s going to go on
   a hunger strike. It would take years before she’d be in any
   kind of danger, but still.

   Sheldon: I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you
   to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel
   Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q
   and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump
   his sorry A.

   Mrs Cooper: I don’t know, Shelly. I thought we could do a
   little sightseeing.

   Sheldon: What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing
   a Nobel laureate?

   Mrs Cooper: Come on, Sheldon, we’ll take your mom to see the
   Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.

   Penny: Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.

   Mrs Cooper: Well, I can’t spend twelve thousand dollars on a
   handbag, but it’s free to look upon those who do with righteous
   condemnation.

   Howard: What do you say?

   Sheldon: What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining
   my mom’s visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your
   slutty shirts. Stop it.

   Howard (after Raj whispers to him): He’s not talking about your
   shirt. Your shirt is fine.

   Scene: The kitchen.

   Leonard: These are delicious.

   Mrs Cooper: The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook
   everything in it.

   Leonard: Everything? Aren’t you worried about your health?

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One
   week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we’re not
   getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.

   Sheldon: Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.

   Mrs Cooper: Apology accepted.

   Sheldon: Great. Now, you’re going to love the Perlmutter
   lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older
   than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in
   your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.

   Mrs Cooper: I am still going out with your friends.

   Sheldon: But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I
   didn’t do anything wrong.

   Mrs Cooper: Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture
   halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So
   why don’t you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.

   Sheldon: I’m not going, and you can’t make me.

   Mrs Cooper: You’re right, I can’t. Have a nice day.

   Sheldon: Well, I’m going to stand here until you change your
   mind.

   Mrs Cooper: Well, then you are going to stand there all day.

   Leonard: I’m just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over
   there.

   Sheldon: I can’t believe my own mother is abandoning me.

   Mrs Cooper: I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is
   leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to
   Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our
   country.

   Sheldon: We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship,
   Mother.

   Mrs Cooper: Well, I guess we are.

   Leonard: Sorry. Syrup.

   Sheldon: All right, Mom. When you’re at the Ripley’s Believe It
   Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw
   away a chance to spend the day with the world’s most wonderful
   son, believe it, because it’s true. (Grabs pancakes and
   snatches syrup from Leonard’s hand)

   Leonard: I hadn’t…

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Sheldon: That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate
   diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery
   wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes)

   Amy: Are you getting sick?

   Sheldon: No, I’m just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes
   for no good reason.

   Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use
   the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn’t
   making you a priority?

   Sheldon: No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.

   Amy: Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building
   block of primate psychology.

   Sheldon: Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with
   you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.

   Amy: Sheldon, we’re all animals. And granted, there are aspects
   of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions
   and relationships, you’re just like everybody else.

   Sheldon: Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems
   are no different than those of a stupid person?

   Amy: Actually, some research indicates that by not
   over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He
   sneezes again) Sure you’re not coming down with a cold?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else.
   You’d love that, wouldn’t you?

   Scene: A church.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, this one’s sweet. You know, for your rosary
   rattlers.

   Leonard: Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.

   Mrs Cooper: My goodness, it’s a wonder you people in California
   can talk at all.

   Penny: This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.

   Leonard: What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.

   Penny: Hey, they have wine here, don’t they?

   Raj (pointing at a crucifixion statue): Hey, none of our gods
   have abs like that.

   Howard: Yep, that’s the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look
   where it got him.

   Mrs Cooper: Hey, while we’re here, why don’t we all do some
   praying? Let’s put a little church in this church.

   Leonard: Oh, I’m not sure we should.

   Mrs Cooper: It’s easy. I’ll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper
   here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank
   you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to
   thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with
   my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.

   Penny: Okay, um, hey, God. What’s up? Um, I’m good, but, uh, it
   would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to
   stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.

   Mrs Cooper: She also goes a little overboard on the love thy
   neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary
   Magdalene. Leonard, you’re up. Wasserman, you’re on deck.

   Leonard: Okay. I don’t know, it’s probably a little late to ask
   you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me
   and my girlfriend. She’s all the way in India. That would be
   great.

   Mrs Cooper: Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both
   wrong on that front. How about you?

   Howard: Oh, me? No. Thanks, I’m good. I’m really just trying
   not to burst into flames.

   Mrs Cooper: Rajesh?

   Howard: He says he’s having trouble dropping those last five
   pounds.

   Mrs Cooper: Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls
   thing.

   Howard: No, you only get one wish.

   Scene: A park bench. Sheldon is sitting. A stranger sits next
   to him.

   Sheldon: Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded
   physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice
   in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours
   as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But
   deep down inside, apparently we’re just two peas in a pod. A
   regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe
   twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling
   on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The
   stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants.

   Scene: The kitchen.

   Penny: Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.

   Mrs Cooper: You take notes, darlin’. The real way to get a man
   is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He’ll die at
   50 but his love will be true.

   Sheldon (entering, soaked): I need a tissue.This one got wet.

   Leonard: Here.

   Sheldon: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve learned something today. You and
   I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts,
   we’re the same. (Sneezes)

   Mrs Cooper: Sweetheart, are you sick?

   Sheldon: I hope so, because if this is well, life isn’t worth
   living.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We’ve got to get
   you to bed.

   Sheldon: Okay.

   Mrs Cooper: Don’t worry. Mama’s here to take care of her baby.

   Sheldon: And just to be clear, only her baby and not these
   other people.

   Mrs Cooper: Of course.

   Sheldon: Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut
   off?

   Mrs Cooper: You can have whatever you want.

   Sheldon: Thanks, Mom.You’re the best.

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Mrs Cooper: Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn’t
   have hair on your chest.

   Sheldon: I know, it filled in last year. I didn’t get to spend
   a lot of time with you on this visit.

   Mrs Cooper: And whose fault was that?

   Sheldon: Yours.

   Mrs Cooper: Shelly, you’re not eight years old any more. We
   have to have a different relationship.

   Sheldon: No, we don’t. The one we have works great.

   Mrs Cooper: Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

   Sheldon: Or maybe I’m part of a new species, that lives for
   hundreds of years, which means I’m still basically a toddler.

   Mrs Cooper: Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.

   Sheldon: Does this mean you’re not going to sing Soft Kitty?

   Mrs Cooper: No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. (Sings) Soft
   kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…

   Leonard (at door): Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that
   pie out of the oven?

   Sheldon: Get out!

   Mrs Cooper: Well, that was rude.

   Sheldon: Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.

   Mrs Cooper: Happy kitty, sleepy kitty…

   Sheldon: What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.

   Mrs Cooper (to God): This is what I’m talking about. (Sings)
   Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur…
