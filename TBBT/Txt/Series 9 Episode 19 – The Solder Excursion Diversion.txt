Series 9 Episode 19 – The Solder Excursion Diversion

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy (on Skype): I didn’t understand your e-mail.

   Sheldon: Uh, can you repeat that? You’re breaking up.

   Amy: I didn’t understand your e-mail.

   Sheldon: Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the
   S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.

   Amy: Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow
   thubtibe tobowow?

   Sheldon: So, is that a yes?

   Amy: Sheldon, why don’t you get a new computer? You know that
   one’s out-of-date.

   Sheldon: Oh, but I like this computer.

   Amy: The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, I didn’t get that.

   Amy: The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.

   Sheldon: The sound is cutting out. I can’t read that. The video
   is failing.

   Amy: Get a new computer.

   Sheldon: What?

   Amy: Get a new computer.

   Sheldon: What? (Answering phone) Hello?

   Amy (on phone) Get a new computer.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Leonard: This is cool. When was the last time you and I built
   something together?

   Howard: Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last
   week in my room.

   Leonard: If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that
   fall apart when you pick them up, we’d be set.

   Penny: Hey, guys.

   Leonard: Hey. What are you doing here?

   Bernadette: We heard there were some sexy scientists working
   hard all weekend.

   Penny: Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go
   look for ’em.

   Leonard: Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom
   used to make.

   Penny: So, how’s it goin’?

   Leonard: Good. Slow.

   Howard: There’s a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through
   that it should go quicker.

   Penny: Is there anything we can do to help?

   Leonard: You know what, this part isn’t that technical. You
   actually could.

   Penny: Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.

   Bernadette: Can we really help?

   Howard: While we finish soldering these boards, it’d be great
   if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

   Leonard: I’ll show you how to do one.

   Penny: Hey, wouldn’t it be funny if after all your years of
   hard work, I’m the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He
   doesn’t think that’s funny.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: I got here as quickly as I could.

   Sheldon: You’re too late.

   Amy: Sheldon, this is silly.

   Sheldon: You got emotional when that lab monkey died.

   Amy: That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.

   Sheldon: Great. Now I’m gonna have that song in my head all
   day.

   Amy: Look, I’m, I’m sorry for your loss, but I think I have
   something that might make you feel better. I got you a new
   computer.

   Sheldon: How could you do that?

   Amy: Do what?

   Sheldon: Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal
   ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious
   research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven’t I
   lost enough today?

   Amy: Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.

   Sheldon: Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn’t realize you’d
   spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a
   4K display and a Thunderbolt port?

   Amy: Yes.

   Sheldon: Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one
   terabyte solid-state drive?

   Amy: Yes.

   Sheldon: Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer
   Solutions on Colorado?

   Amy: Yes.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Leonard: After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends
   get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.

   Penny: Like this?

   Leonard: Yeah, perfect.

   Penny: Oh.

   Leonard: And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don’t
   be discouraged if you can’t do it as fast as me and Howard.

   Howard: I don’t know if we have enough solder to finish these
   circuit boards.

   Leonard: We had a full spool yesterday.

   Howard: What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.

   Bernadette: Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off.
   It’s like a beer commercial.

   Leonard: Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.

   Penny: How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of
   solder?

   Leonard: Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40
   tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the
   63/37 tin-to-lead…

   Penny: Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a
   funny story.

   Howard: You want to come with us?

   Bernadette: I’m kind of getting into the groove here.

   Penny: Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle
   the science for a change.

   Leonard: Okay. We’ll be back as soon as we can.

   Penny: Okay, so what is solder?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to
   rob me of that, too?

   Amy: Knock it off or I’ll start making W-H sounds for words
   that just have a W.

   Sheldon: You wouldn’t.

   Amy: Whatch me.

   Sheldon: Fine. I’m sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I
   really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to
   my old laptop. But I’m sure, in time, that this one will…
   Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.

   Amy: I thought you might like it.

   Sheldon: Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I’m
   gonna count all those nostril hairs.

   Amy: Or you could just look into my eyes.

   Sheldon: But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril
   hairs.

   Amy: Well, you know, as long as you’re happy.

   Sheldon: Oh. I am.

   Amy: And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle
   it.

   Sheldon: Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.

   Amy: Oh, but he said you can get store credit.

   Sheldon: Well, no, I just, I, I don’t want to recycle it. And I
   don’t want store credit.

   Amy: But why wouldn’t…

   Sheldon: Can we please change the subject?

   Amy: Okay. How ’bout we change it to why you’re being weird
   about this?

   Sheldon: I’m not being weird. I, it’s hard to explain.

   Amy: Sheldon, just tell me.

   Sheldon: It might be easier to show you.

   Amy: Okay.

   Sheldon: We’d have to take your car.

   Amy: All right.

   Sheldon: And I’m gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure
   agreement.

   Amy: Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?

   Scene: A street.

   Leonard: Penny says they’re having fun working on the
   prototype.

   Howard: Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking
   games?

   Leonard: I know. I’m lowering the bar so slowly. This time next
   year she’ll have a coin collection.

   Man: Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an
   upcoming movie?

   Leonard: Oh. Sorry, we can’t.

   Howard: Well, hang on. What movie is it?

   Man: Oh, I can’t tell you. But it does star Will Smith.

   Howard: Wait. I bet it’s Suicide Squad. Let’s check it out.

   Leonard: What about the girls?

   Howard: Penny just said they’re having fun. Honestly, you want
   to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?

   Leonard: Okay, we’ll take ’em. But, I swear, if it’s Will Smith
   in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Penny: I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? I moved here from Nebraska
   to be an actress, and now I’m sitting in an engineering lab at
   Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance
   system.

   Bernadette: It is crazy. It’s also crazy that I’ve made
   fourteen of these and you’ve made three.

   Raj: Hey. Where are the guys?

   Penny: Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal
   you melt to make science things.

   Bernadette: Since when do you work on weekends?

   Raj: I’m an astrophysicist. The stars don’t take a day off.

   Penny: You were home alone and had no one to play with?

   Raj: Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn’t like
   me. You need any help?

   Bernadette: Not with Lightning McQueen here.

   Penny: I think we’re good.

   Raj: Okay. That’s cool. I guess everybody’s involved in this
   project but me. So, see ya.

   Bernadette: I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?

   Raj (from outside): Yes.

   Scene: Amy’s car.

   Amy: Will you please tell me where we’re going?

   Sheldon: Sorry, you’re on a need-to-know basis.

   Amy: I’m driving the car. I need to know.

   Sheldon: Right.

   Amy: So where are we going?

   Sheldon: No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you
   do need to know.

   Scene: The cinema.

   Leonard: What are we gonna tell the girls?

   Howard: It’s not a problem.

   Leonard: I mean without lying.

   Howard: And now you’ve made it a problem.

   Leonard: Come on. We’re a couple of smart guys. I’m sure we can
   come up with a way to explain this that doesn’t make us look
   bad.

   Penny (at Howard’s workshop, reading text): Oh, the boys had to
   drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a
   flat.

   Leonard: They bought it.

   Howard: But we’re gonna have to put the spare on before we go
   back.

   Leonard: Oh, you’re good at this.

   Howard: Well, I lie a lot.

   Man: Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test
   screening. You’re about to be one of the first audiences to see
   Suicide Squad.

   Leonard: Hey, you were right.

   Howard: Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad
   people.

   Man: Uh, we’re gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.

   Leonard: Who are you texting?

   Howard: Raj. He really wants to see this movie.

   Leonard: He’ll never make it in time.

   Howard: I know. I want to make him feel bad.

   Leonard: Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad.
   Spoiler alert, when I see you I’m gonna spoil it. You’re a good
   friend.

   Raj (at the workshop): Okay. Would you ladies please leave the
   room for a moment?

   Penny: Why?

   Raj: I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.

   Bernadette: What’s going on?

   Raj: Leonard and Howard don’t have a flat. They went to the
   movies. Look.

   Penny: Un-freakin’ believable.

   Bernadette: Son of a bitch.

   Raj: Oh. You know what? I’m gonna let them know that I’m here
   with you and that they’re busted.

   Penny: No. You know what? Don’t. Don’t. Let’s let them think
   they’re getting away with it.

   Bernadette: Yeah, let’s see how deep a hole they can dig for
   themselves.

   Penny: Mm-hmm.

   Raj: Interesting. I mean, it’s not testicles on a cryostat, but
   I like it.

   Scene: A storage facility.

   Amy: Why do you have a storage unit?

   Sheldon: Just wait.

   Amy: How long have you had it?

   Sheldon: Just wait.

   Amy: Do you want me to hold that computer?

   Sheldon: Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you.
   Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.

   Amy: I’m sorry. What, what am I looking at?

   Sheldon: It’s basically everything I’ve ever owned. Um, every
   book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just
   all of it.

   Amy: All of it?

   Sheldon: I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc
   bags.

   Amy: Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing
   here to be ashamed of. So I’m gonna need a minute.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Penny: All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?

   Raj: I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.

   Penny: Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but
   do you really think you could handle making out with both of
   us?

   Raj: No, ma’am.

   Bernadette: Okay. Okay, how about this? They don’t know you’re
   here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up,
   we’ll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were,
   we’ll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got
   away with it, you jump out.

   Penny: Yeah, that’s pretty good.

   Raj: I love it, I’ll be all like, busted, and they’ll be like,
   what? And then we’ll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I
   wouldn’t make out with me, either.

   Scene: The storage unit.

   Sheldon: In here is every clock radio I’ve ever owned.
   Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.

   Amy: You have sporting equipment?

   Sheldon: Well, oh, it’s just a, it’s a, a golf ball that my
   brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It’s
   right next to the hockey puck dent.

   Amy: Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?

   Sheldon: I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of
   scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you
   tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.

   Amy: So, why do you feel you need to save these things?

   Sheldon: I’d like to say it’s nostalgia, but every time I think
   of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get
   butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the
   butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten
   by…

   Amy: Okay. I get it. I get it.

   Sheldon: It ends with dinosaurs. I’m sorry if you think less of
   me.

   Amy: I don’t.

   Sheldon: Really? ‘Cause every time I come in here, I think less
   of me.

   Amy: Why?

   Sheldon: Because I’m a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the
   mind. I’ve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity,
   but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the
   internet when I’ve never even thrown a toothbrush away?

   Amy: It’s okay, Sheldon. You know, I’ve saved a lot of weird
   things, too.

   Sheldon: Like what?

   Amy: Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a
   little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?

   Sheldon: I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on
   for years.

   Amy: It’s not a contest.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Penny: Okay, here they come.

   Bernadette: Go hide.

   Raj: Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I’m gonna nail
   those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Howard: Hi.

   Penny: Hey, what’s this?

   Leonard: Listen, we did a stupid thing.

   Howard: We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad
   and want to make it up to you.

   Leonard: So, these are for you, and if you’re not too mad, we’d
   love to take you guys to dinner.

   Howard: Yeah. Anywhere you want.

   Bernadette: Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.

   Penny: Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of
   have fun working on the prototype.

   Raj (inside cupboard): Don’t forgive them. Stay mad at them.

   Howard: What is he doing in there?

   Raj: Busting you.

   Bernadette: It’s okay. They apologized.

   Penny: Yeah, it’s fine.

   Raj: Well this is kind of anti-climactic.

   Howard: You know what wasn’t anti-climactic? The end of the
   movie. Get this.

   Raj: No spoilers. No spoilers.

   Penny: And he’s back in the closet.

   Howard: Ready for dinner?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Bernadette: Should we invite Raj?

   Raj (in cupboard): Yes.

   Scene: The storage unit.

   Amy: So, no one else knows about this?

   Sheldon: Only you.

   Amy: Thank you for trusting me.

   Sheldon: What good is having a girlfriend if you can’t unload
   your psychological sewage on her?

   Amy: That’s me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever
   decide you want to do something about this, I’m, I’m here for
   you.

   Sheldon: Thank you. I wouldn’t even know how to begin.

   Amy: Baby steps, I guess.

   Sheldon: I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.

   Amy: Oh. Okay.

   Sheldon: I will always have the dent to remember it by.

   Amy: You did it. Do you feel okay?

   Sheldon: Actually, yes. I do.

   Amy: Well, I’m proud of you.

   Sheldon: Thanks.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I’m glad I told you about the storage unit.

   Amy: Well, I feel closer to you now.

   Sheldon: Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it’s still a
   couple of hours until my bedtime.

   Amy: What did you have in mind?

   Scene: The same, shortly afterwards.

   Sheldon: You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is
   remarkable.

   Amy (on Skype): I really had to go home for this?

   Sheldon: Yes, but it’s like you’re right here in the room.

   Amy: And yet, I’m not.

   Sheldon: But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.

   Amy: And yet, you can’t.

   Sheldon: I know.
