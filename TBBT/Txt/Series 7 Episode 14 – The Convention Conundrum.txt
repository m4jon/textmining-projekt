Series 7 Episode 14 – The Convention Conundrum

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: T-minus 60 seconds.

   Raj: Oh, it all comes down to this.

   Leonard: Oh, I’ve got butterflies.

   Sheldon: Don’t get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those
   glasses right off your face.

   Penny: What’s going on?

   Leonard: Hey. We’re about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.

   Penny: Oh.

   Howard: T Minus 45 seconds.

   Leonard: They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of
   us gets in, we can buy passes…

   Sheldon: Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it
   in your pants.

   Penny: This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.

   Howard: T-minus 30 seconds.

   Raj: Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.

   Sheldon: Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.

   Raj: And I told you I get diaper rash.

   Howard: 15 seconds.

   Leonard: Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.

   Howard: Five, four, three, two, one.

   Sheldon: It’s live. Go, go, go, go, go.

   Raj: Anyone in?

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: Not yet.

   Howard: Nope.

   Sheldon: Do not stop refreshing your screens.

   All (repeatedly): Refresh. Refresh. Refresh….

   Penny: Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The same, shortly after.

   All (repeatedly): Refresh… Refresh… Refresh…

   Howard: It’s been ten minutes. We’re running out of time.

   Penny: To be cool? Yeah.

   Leonard: I did it, I did it, I’m in the queue.

   Sheldon: Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.

   Raj: Uh, what number in line are you?

   Leonard: Uh, fifteen…

   Howard: Great.

   Leonard: …thousand two hundred and eleven.

   Howard: Damn.

   Raj: Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.

   Howard: Really?

   Leonard: Oh, Thursday’s gone. Just Sunday left.

   Sheldon: Oh, Sunday’s the worst. Everybody’s leaving, most of
   the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left
   are small and XXXXL.

   Leonard: Sunday’s gone.

   Sheldon: Not Sunday, I love Sunday.

   Raj: So that’s it? Everything’s sold out?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Howard: I can’t believe we’re not going.

   Sheldon: It’s okay. You know, there, there’s always WonderCon
   in Anaheim, you know? That, that’s just as good. Excuse me.

   Penny: Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way
   than it was twenty minutes ago.

   Sheldon: I can’t believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk
   costumes.

   Penny: What? You were all going as the Hulk?

   Howard: Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.

   Raj: We would have been the angry green belles of the
   masquerade ball.

   All: Yeah.

   Penny: And we’re back to the first kind of sad.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con
   problem. We don’t need them. I’m starting my own convention.

   Leonard: Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.

   Sheldon: I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the
   rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for
   life. Life, Leonard. You’re gonna feel pretty silly when we’re
   80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait
   in the car for three days.

   Leonard: Do what you want. We’re getting scalped tickets.

   Howard: I already found a guy online who’s willing to sell.

   Sheldon: How do you know this isn’t a sting operation set up by
   the Comic-Con police?

   Leonard: The same way I know that the people in the TV set
   can’t see me.

   Howard: Sheldon, just come with us. You’re not gonna make your
   own convention.

   Sheldon: You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn’t exist
   at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it
   happen. And you mark my words, I’m gonna rip that guy off.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon (on phone): Yes, I’m starting my own comic book
   convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr.,
   would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now,
   why are you saying no? You haven’t even asked him yet. You
   know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he
   owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.

   Leonard: Did you tell them that you’re holding your convention
   at a Marie Callender’s, and that every panellist gets a free
   slice of pie?

   Sheldon: I didn’t even get to that part.

   Leonard: Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a
   waste of time.

   Sheldon: Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just
   concerned that he wasn’t a big enough celebrity to headline
   such an amazing event. Also, that’s the same day that he
   shampoos his beard.

   Leonard: Sheldon, buddy, I just don’t think this is going to
   come together for you.

   Sheldon: You don’t know that. I still have plenty of solid
   leads on this list.

   Leonard: Good luck.

   Sheldon: No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy
   and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ’cause, legally, I’m not allowed
   to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ’cause I hear he
   can be pretty nuts.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: I can’t believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars
   on scalped tickets.

   Amy: Last week, you spent that on a little dress.

   Penny: Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con.
   That dress gets me into anywhere I want.

   Bernadette: Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give
   Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he’s never gonna put his
   toys away.

   Amy: Why can’t they do something sensible like Sheldon and
   start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw
   me out that window?

   Bernadette: Well, while they’re acting like teenagers, we could
   do something grown-up.

   Amy: Oh. You mean like a museum?

   Penny: Yes, like a museum, but anything else.

   Bernadette: Oh, I know. There’s a nice hotel not far from here
   where they do afternoon tea.

   Amy: Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.

   Penny: Oh, all right, if we’re gonna be fancy, I should
   probably put on clean underwear.

   Bernadette: La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.

   Penny: No, we’re gonna stop at Target on the way.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Hey, since Sheldon’s not going to Comic-Con, maybe we
   could find a cool trio to dress up as.

   Leonard: Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just
   tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.

   Howard: Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with
   women who don’t exist were over.

   Sheldon: Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge
   guest for my convention.

   Leonard: Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct
   tape?

   Sheldon: I don’t think that will be necessary for Mr. James
   Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion
   King’s dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also
   sounds like Darth Vader.

   Raj: How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?

   Sheldon: Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he’s looking
   forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner.
   I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted
   in his favourite sushi restaurant. That’s where he’ll be, and
   that’s where I’m going, and…

   Howard: And that’s where Darth Vader’s gonna pour soy sauce on
   your head.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t care if you get scalped tickets with
   us or not, but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor
   guy. You’re gonna get in trouble.

   Sheldon: You’re the ones who are going to get in trouble.
   You’re buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no
   less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught,
   you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that
   while I’m warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting
   his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some
   weirdoes out there. (To the Imperial March theme) Bom, bom,
   bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom,
   badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom,
   forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum…

   Scene: The same, later.

   Howard (on phone): Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood
   scalper says he’s running late.

   Raj: Does he sound like a criminal?

   Howard: What do you mean?

   Raj: You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen
   here, see?

   Leonard: Yes. He, he’s late because he’s on his way here from
   1940.

   Raj: I’m just saying, we don’t know who this guy is. What if he
   wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof
   our skins?

   Howard: Why would someone want to make clothes out of your
   skin?

   Raj: I don’t know. Maybe ’cause dark doesn’t show the stains?

   Leonard: Well, now you’re making me wonder if we should have
   met him at a neutral location.

   Howard: Why do you think I told him to come to your place?

   Scene: Hotel tea room.

   Amy: There sure are a lot of little kids here.

   Penny: I can’t believe we thought this would makes us feel
   grown up.

   Bernadette: I can’t believe the waiter thought I was your
   daughter.

   Amy: Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I
   was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster.

   Bernadette: That’s cute.

   Amy: It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less
   cute really fast.

   Bernadette: Should we leave?

   Penny: Well, there’s a bar in the lobby.

   Bernadette: I could go for a drink.

   Amy: Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.

   Scene: A sushi restaurant.

   James Earl Jones: Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know,
   I’ve been in other movies. But you don’t care about those, do
   you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star
   Wars, too. Care to join me?

   Sheldon: Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you
   while you were eating, you’d think I was a creepy stalker.

   James Earl Jones: Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real
   weenie.

   Sheldon: He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Okay, so, I’m on a Comic-Con message board, and there’s a
   post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone
   else’s badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with
   petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch,
   that might send the wrong message.

   Leonard: Maybe this isn’t a good idea.

   Howard: I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.

   Raj: Do it.

   Howard: Okay. We’re officially not going to Comic-Con.

   Leonard: Hold on. We always do this.

   Howard: Do what?

   Leonard: Chicken out. We’re, we’re so afraid of getting into
   trouble that we never do anything wrong.

   Raj: That’s ’cause we’re the good guys.

   Leonard: Even Batman breaks the rules.

   Raj: You know I struggle with Batman.

   Leonard: I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let’s be
   badasses.

   Raj: Okay, I’ll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be
   one, too.

   Leonard: Howard, you in on this?

   Howard: No need. I’m breaking rules all the time.

   Leonard: Name one.

   Howard: Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.

   Raj: What about that little cup they give you?

   Howard: Yeah. What about it?

   Raj: Are you impressed by that?

   Leonard: A little.

   Raj: Yeah, me, too.

   Scene: The sushi restaurant.

   James: You know, when I first read the script for Empire
   Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I
   thought for sure he was lying.

   Sheldon: Me, too. But he wasn’t, was he?

   James: He was not. How messed up was that?

   Sheldon: So messed up.

   James: What do you say let’s go have some fun? My wife’s in New
   York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in
   my pocket.

   Scene: The hotel bar.

   Penny: So, afternoon tea was a bust.

   Amy: On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous
   of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.

   Penny: Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start
   feeling grown up? ‘Cause I am not sure I do.

   Bernadette: Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but
   I still kind of feel like I’m pretending. It doesn’t help that
   most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.

   Penny: Okay, so I’m an adult, and the other day I saw an old
   man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard.
   Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would’ve heard
   me.

   Amy: Gosh.

   Penny: I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and
   bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I
   guess you had to be there.

   Amy: I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like
   a grown-up when you’ve never even been with a man.

   Penny: Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.

   Bernadette: Yeah. Or you’d be the oldest one here.

   Penny: Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: He just parked. He’s on his way up.

   Leonard: Good. This is exciting.

   Raj: It is. I feel alive.

   Leonard: Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get
   banned from Comic-Con.

   Raj: Maybe slapped with a fine.

   Howard: Oh, no. I’d be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will
   women keep their pants on?

   Raj: Uh, maybe it’ll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh,
   crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship?

   Leonard: I wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this
   when we apply for grants.

   Raj: He’s gonna be here any second, what should we do?

   Howard: Okay, you guys are such babies. I’ll handle this. If he
   thinks we’re not home, he’ll go away.

   Raj: I thought you were a badass.

   Howard: I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.

   Scene: An ice cream parlour.

   Sheldon: Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were
   functionally mute for eight years?

   James: It is true.

   Sheldon: Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the
   sound of Darth Vader breathing?

   James: They sure did.

   Sheldon: Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and
   you almost became a doctor?

   James: That’s right.

   Sheldon: Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.

   Scene: The hotel bar.

   Penny: I mean, really, what’s so great about being grown up?

   Bernadette: Well, for starters, we’d be splitting this check
   three ways.

   Penny: I’m serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have
   insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when
   you hit a parked car.

   Amy: I told you it was Penny.

   Penny: Oh, come on, it wasn’t me. Anyone could have knocked
   your mirror off, or whatever happened.

   Amy: Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night
   trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I’m sure
   they’re having more fun than we are.

   Scene: The apartment. Banging on door.

   Howard: Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of
   Pepto right now.

   Scene: A big wheel.

   Sheldon: Hey, Los Angeles. I’m on a Ferris Wheel with Darth
   Vader. And he’s nicer than you think.

   James: I am.

   Scene: A karaoke bar.

   Sheldon: In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps
   tonight…

   James: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…

   Sheldon: Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um,
   um-a-weh.

   James: Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh…

   Sceme: Outside a house.

   Sheldon: I don’t understand what we’re doing.

   James: Shh.

   Sheldon: Whose house is this?

   James: Carrie Fisher. And she’s a little crazy, so get ready to
   run. (Rings doorbell)

   Carrie Fisher: It’s not funny anymore, James.

   James: Then why am I laughing?

   Scene: A sauna.

   James: Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.

   Sheldon: Okay. But I think it could have ended with the
   karaoke.

   James: What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?

   Sheldon: Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?

   James: No. Something about a convention.

   Sheldon: Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn’t get into
   Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own
   convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.

   James: Why don’t you and your friends come to Comic-Con with
   me?

   Sheldon: Really?

   James: Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from
   my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I’m taking you every
   night.

   Sheldon: Ay-yi-yi.

   James: Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.

   Scene: The same, later.

   James: So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is
   on Marlon Brando’s shoulders, and remember, we do not have
   permission to be in the pool… hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie
   Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the
   water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises
   about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs
   freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh,
   boy, that was a lot of fun.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, who’s Angie Dickinson?
