Series 6 Episode 21 – The Closure Alternative

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our
   DVR again?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come
   later.

   Penny: Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can’t afford another
   demerit.

   Leonard: Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese
   have been hacking everything lately.

   Sheldon: Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart:
   Mall Cop?

   Leonard: I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny
   everywhere.

   Sheldon: I’m deleting it.

   Penny: Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven’t finished
   watching it yet.

   Leonard: You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR,
   why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already
   watched? Like, um, Alphas.

   Sheldon: No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the
   cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three
   starts.

   Leonard: There is no season three. They cancelled that show.

   Sheldon: Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.

   Leonard: They did.

   Penny: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want
   them?

   Sheldon: Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?

   Penny: As a rule, no.

   Sheldon: That show ended with all the residents of New York
   either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what
   happened.

   Penny: Well, why don’t you make up your own ending?

   Sheldon: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll
   make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of
   flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the
   number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.

   Leonard: Oh, please, don’t do that.

   Sheldon: No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You
   know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie
   to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a
   comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by
   season till we were grateful it ended.

   Penny: I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.

   Leonard: Ah, don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by
   crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel.

   Credits sequence

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Howard: I think you’re gonna be really happy with this security
   camera. The optics are great, it’s got infrared technology, and
   there’s even a backup battery when the power goes out.

   Raj: Whatever. I can see my little princess while I’m at work,
   right?

   Howard: Why can’t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I
   need your laptop so I can configure the software.

   Raj: Wait, hold on. This is weird.

   Howard: What?

   Raj: I was Googling that girl I’ve been dating, and I found her
   blog.

   Howard: Cool. Anything juicy?

   Raj: She said she recently went on a date with a guy named
   Roger? And he’s Indian? And he’s an astrophysicist, too?

   Howard: You know what’s going on, don’t you?

   Raj: Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually
   voracious devils.

   Howard: I can’t believe I have to explain this. People change
   names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.

   Raj: Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be
   Gavin.

   Howard: Keep reading. What does it say?

   Raj: No, no, I don’t know if I should. If she wanted me to know
   about her blog, she would’ve told me. It’s almost like I’m
   reading her diary.

   Howard: It’s exactly what it’s like. Keep reading.

   Raj: No, this is creepy.

   Howard: Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview
   mirror when I put up that camera.

   Raj: It’s not creepy. Don’t listen to him. Oh, look who’s got
   the sweetest kisses.

   Howard: Should I go?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the
   greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars
   themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy
   the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us.
   It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I
   cannot oversell this. What do you say?

   Penny: It’s six thirty in the morning.

   Leonard: I thought you grew up on a farm.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon (on phone): Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your
   vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible
   mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it
   immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who
   handle that, you tell them it’s me, and I don’t want to answer
   a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you
   know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who
   just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb
   concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. Why do
   they keep hanging up on me?

   Amy: I’m sorry you’re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes
   people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like
   this.

   Sheldon: I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give
   me a hug.

   Amy: Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a
   pathological need for closure.

   Sheldon: Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about
   your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.

   Amy: You know, I might be able to help you with this. There’s a
   whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to
   retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you
   less.

   Sheldon: Yeah, but I just told you, I don’t have a problem with
   closure.

   Amy: You sure about that?

   Sheldon: Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the
   table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.)
   That proves nothing.

   Scene: Raj’s office.

   Howard: Ready to go to lunch?

   Raj: Do you think I’m feminine?

   Howard: Yeah. Let’s go.

   Raj: Thanks a lot.

   Howard: What’s going on?

   Raj: I broke down, and I read Lucy’s blog, and in one of the
   entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little
   feminine.

   Howard: Just a little? That’s great.

   Raj: I have to talk to her about this.

   Howard: Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about
   things? Listen to me, if she’s writing about your relationship,
   use it to your advantage. Rig the game.

   Raj: Well, that doesn’t seem fair.

   Howard: Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more
   than nervous weirdos?

   Raj: No, it’s not. I’ve always thought that was unfair.

   Howard: So take what’s in that blog and use it to get her pants
   off.

   Raj: Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn’t
   you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her
   heart?

   Howard: The key to her heart. That’s nice. Were you quoting
   someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?

   Raj: I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women,
   Sir Elton John.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could
   you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.

   Penny: It was cute.

   Leonard: Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst.

   Penny: What’s wrong with cute?

   Leonard: It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.

   Penny: So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?

   Leonard: You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I
   don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be
   excited by it.

   Penny: I liked it. I’m excited.

   Leonard: Well, then, tell your face.

   Penny: What do you want from me?

   Leonard: You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s
   just see what else is on.

   Penny: Oh, come on, don’t be like that.

   Leonard: Well…

   Penny: I’m sorry I called it cute. Let’s watch another one.

   Leonard: Really?

   Penny: Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school.
   But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out
   at night and had messed up teeth.

   Leonard: All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one
   better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.

   Penny: Oh. Well, that’s like my high school, too. But instead
   of a curse, it was crabs.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: I’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your
   compulsive need for closure.

   Sheldon: I take issue with the word compulsive.

   Amy: All I’m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn’t
   always an op…

   Sheldon: …tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let’s say I
   have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?

   Amy: I’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for
   completion isn’t so overwhelming.

   Sheldon: By playing tic-tac-toe?

   Amy: Yep. Your turn.

   Sheldon: Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience
   is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can
   only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me
   closure. Especially since I’m about to win. (She wipes the
   board clean.) B-But we didn’t finish.

   Amy: Exactly. How does that make you feel?

   Sheldon: The same way any normal person would. I feel like I
   want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again
   and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.

   Amy: And that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with
   this course of treatment.

   Sheldon: Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get
   this face off.

   Amy: Come on, you can do this.

   Sheldon: You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely
   frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied
   any opportunity for release.

   Amy: Yeah, sounds like a drag.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so
   much?

   Bernadette: Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you
   do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but
   this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?

   Penny: Yippee, it’s backwards. I get it.

   Bernadette: Why does this bother you so much?

   Penny: I don’t know. It’s just, he’s so passionate about so
   many different things. I just don’t get that way. Do you?

   Bernadette: Well, sure. I’m pretty passionate about science. I
   remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw
   millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other
   universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb
   like a god.

   Penny: See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean,
   I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.

   Bernadette: Well, there’s no reason you can’t.

   Penny: You think?

   Bernadette: Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little
   time and find something you’re passionate about.

   Penny: Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Howard (on webcam): Hey, what’s up?

   Raj: Uh, Lucy’s coming over. I need some advice.

   Howard: However long you think the foreplay should be, triple
   it.

   Raj: Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This
   hockey jersey or this football jersey.

   Howard: I don’t know. Go with hockey.

   Raj: Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that’s her. I got to go
   be butch. Toodles. Hey.

   Lucy: Hi.

   Raj: Come in.

   Lucy: Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.

   Raj: Yeah, well, I wouldn’t get too close. If I give the right
   command in German, she’ll rip your face off.

   Scene: The apartment. Montage of scenes.

   1. Amy (singing): O’er the land of the free, and the home of
   the… Next.

   2. (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes)
   Amy: That’s quite an impressive layout, isn’t it?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Amy: Let’s box it up.

   Sheldon: Let’s box it up.

   3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just
   before the end of the tune) Amy: That’s enough. Sheldon,
   Sheldon, give it!

   4. Amy: Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles.
   Oops, missed one. Now your wish can’t come true.

   Sheldon: Lucky for you, ’cause I wished you were dead.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Lucy: I like your jersey.

   Raj: Thanks. I love hockey.

   Lucy: Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time
   growing up. Who’s your favourite player?

   Raj: Not Brian Boitano, that’s for sure. How’s your burrito?

   Lucy: It’s still a little frozen in the middle.

   Raj: Probably because I didn’t read the instructions. No
   wrapper’s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is
   Jay-Z.

   Lucy: Is something going on?

   Raj: What do you mean?

   Lucy: Well, you’re acting all weird, and I’m pretty weird, so I
   think I know what I’m talking about.

   Raj: I don’t know. Maybe it’s all those steroids I’ve been
   taking.

   Lucy: I think I’m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the
   pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are
   better than regular trucks.

   Raj: Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.

   Lucy: Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn’t think
   anybody actually read it.

   Raj: No kidding. You didn’t make it easy to find. I spent hours
   digging around online. For the record, you have excellent
   credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to
   her new leg just fine.

   Lucy: Why were you acting so strange tonight?

   Raj: You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was
   more manly.

   Lucy: Raj, I didn’t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that
   you’re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like
   caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.

   Raj: I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.

   Lucy: So, are you okay?

   Raj: Yeah.

   Lucy: Good. Do you even like hockey?

   Raj: No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see
   Taylor Swift.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like
   Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.

   Leonard: The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to
   the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.

   Penny: See, that’s the kind of passion I didn’t think I had.
   But then I realized I’m passionate about you.

   Leonard: Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.

   Penny: No, I’m serious. Look, I’ve always had these plans. I
   was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and
   anything less than that just wasn’t worth getting excited
   about.

   Leonard: Those things can still happen.

   Penny: Oh, obviously it’s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a
   bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I
   shouldn’t wait, you know? I’ve got you, I’ve got Sheldon, all
   these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.

   Leonard: That’s a big deal.

   Penny: It is, isn’t it?

   Leonard: So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about
   cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to
   Comic-Con?

   Penny: Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this
   has truly been a transformative evening.

   Amy: I’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.

   Sheldon: Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a
   wonderful girlfriend, and…

   Amy: And?

   Sheldon: Doesn’t matter, does it?

   Amy: I’m proud of you, Sheldon. (Exits.)

   Sheldon: And a complete sucker.

   (Montage of sccenes)

   1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Sheldon: Oh, yeah.

   2. (Blows out all candles on the cake)

   3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) Sheldon: There
   he is.

   4. Sheldon (singing): And the home of the brave.

   5. (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern) Sheldon:
   Don’t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.

   Almost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!

   Penny: Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love
   that you’re in my life.

   Sheldon: I love you, too.

   Scene: Later.

   Sheldon: Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the
   season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound
   nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual
   relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show
   ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you
   planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all
   stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.
