Series 6 Episode 18 – The Contractual Obligation Implementation

   Scene: The apartment

   Leonard: Look, I know you guys don’t want to do this, but we
   have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can
   just get it over with.

   Howard: I got whine.

   Sheldon: I got the B word.

   Leonard: Yeah, well, it’s in our contract to serve on a
   university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in.
   Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in
   the sciences.

   Howard: Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do
   stuff, I wouldn’t have spent so much of my twenties in the
   shower.

   Sheldon: If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our
   time.

   Leonard: Helping women? Y

   Sheldon: Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.

   Leonard: Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the
   dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?

   Sheldon: I’m not saying people can’t use tools. Even an otter
   picks up a rock when he wants a clam.

   Leonard: You don’t think it’s worthwhile to try to get more
   women working in science.

   Sheldon: I think that’s incredibly sexist of you. I believe in
   a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men
   of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.

   Leonard: You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an
   interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the
   space phone?

   Howard: Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant
   Uhura.

   Sheldon: Howard’s disturbing recollections aside, I don’t
   appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.

   Leonard: Yes, I know, you’re too smart for this.

   Sheldon: Exactly. It’s like asking the Human Torch to heat up
   your frozen burrito.

   Leonard: Got it. All right, I’m thinking one way to counter
   bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted
   under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha
   Smith.

   Sheldon: I suppose there is a history of professional women
   using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter’s
   J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek’s D.C. Fontana.

   Howard: Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think
   we’ve really helped women today. Let’s fire up the old Xbox.

   Leonard: Guys, please don’t make this a school project where
   I’m the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit
   back and watch.

   Sheldon: We’re not. This time you’re the smart kid doing all
   the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.

   Howard: So, you think I’m one of the smarter kids?

   Sheldon: No, you’re a tool I was using to make my point.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can
   you at least play a less sexist game

   Sheldon: How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as
   well as any man.

   Howard: Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse
   a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin
   Robbins.

   Sheldon: Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear
   glass ceilings shattering all over town.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you’re always saying how much smarter you are
   than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to
   get more women into science.

   Sheldon: All your ideas address the issue at a university
   level. By then it’s too late. You need to design an outreach
   program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets
   them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.

   Leonard: That’s actually good. Why didn’t I think of that?

   Sheldon: Some people are otters, some people are rocks.

   Leonard: I wonder if there’s a way we could give the idea a
   trial run.

   Howard: Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can
   talk to some of the female students.

   Leonard: That’s great, try to set up something for the three of
   us to go over there.

   Sheldon: Oh, hold on. While I’m comfortable speaking about
   science, I’m not sure I know how to spark the interest of
   schoolchildren. Better Google it.

   Howard: What exactly are you looking up?

   Sheldon: How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.

   Leonard and Howard (together): No!

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Raj: Thanks again for letting me crash girls’ night.

   Penny: Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue.
   I’ve slept with guys for less. It’s a joke. Based on real
   events.

   Raj: Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a
   little. I’m supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a
   killer first date.

   Amy: Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted
   to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an
   unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks,
   picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.

   Raj: Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we
   could start with something simpler.

   Bernadette: Why don’t you take her to Disneyland? You go on
   Space Mountain, you’re in the dark, she’s holding onto you.

   Penny: Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is
   shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the
   end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It’s a joke.
   Based on real events.

   Raj: Mm, Disneyland? I don’t know. With all the crowds and the
   weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of
   India.

   Amy: I haven’t been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should
   definitely go one weekend.

   Bernadette: Weekends are too crowded.

   Penny: So, blow off work, go on a weekday.

   Amy: Hooky? I’ve never played hooky in my life. My mom said
   that’s how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.

   Penny: It’s more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel
   with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.

   Bernadette: Joke?

   Penny: I can laugh about it now.

   Bernadette: So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and
   go to Disneyland?

   Penny: I’m in.

   Amy: Me, too.

   Raj: Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?

   Penny: Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?

   Raj: I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out
   how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such
   crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people.

   Penny: Yeah, that’s a toughie.

   Bernadette: Let’s think.

   Amy: Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?

   Scene: A school hallway.

   Leonard: It’s nice of your old school to let us try out our
   science talk on some female students.

   Howard: Well, they’re actually pretty excited. I’m their most
   famous alum. If you don’t count the serial killer who ate all
   those prostitutes.

   Sheldon: This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to
   your alma mater as an astronaut.

   Howard: Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little
   nerd.

   Leonard: And now you’re also an astronaut.

   Howard: So many memories. I mean, how many times in these
   hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here’s
   my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still
   can’t figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to
   fit in there. (Kid bumps into him) Hey.

   Kid: What?

   Howard: Nothing.

   Sheldon: Smart. We don’t want any problems.

   Scene: Bernadette’s car.

   Amy: I can’t believe I ditched work for Disneyland.

   Bernadette: What did you tell your boss?

   Amy: Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven
   o’clock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and
   casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty,
   I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At
   eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire
   hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry
   heaving sounds, and now I’m going to Disneyland.

   Bernadette: Penny, what did you say?

   Penny: I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.

   Amy: So, what are we gonna do first?

   Bernadette: I don’t know about you guys, but I’m gonna make a
   beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.

   Amy: Ooh, that sounds like fun.

   Penny: You’re kidding, right? We’re not just gonna get drunk
   and go on rides?

   Amy: Come on, do it with us.

   Penny: All right, whatever. How does it work?

   Bernadette: Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty,
   Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.

   Penny: Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.

   Amy: Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.

   Penny: Yeah.

   Bernadette: We can’t all be Cinderella.

   Amy: Then how do we decide?

   Bernadette: Well, it’s simple. This was my idea. I’m driving.
   I’m Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could
   stop the car right now.

   Scene: A library.

   Raj: Excuse me, I’m meeting a girl here. It’s kind of our first
   date.

   Man: In a library?

   Raj: She and I are both a little awkward in social situations,
   so this seemed like a good idea.

   Man: People say I’m a little awkward, too. May I join you?

   Raj: No, you can’t join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever
   beanstalk you came down from.

   Man (to Lucy): You can do better.

   Lucy: Oh, we’re eating here? (Reading) We’re having a texting
   date? (By text) I love that.

   Raj (by text): As you’re reading, it will help to remember I
   have an adorable accent.

   Scene: A classroom.

   Leonard: Okay, who’s ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I
   am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper
   and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to
   show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you
   ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ’cause that’s the
   temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I
   just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All
   right. So now let’s bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon
   Cooper.

   Sheldon: Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a
   story about a great female scientist. Polish-born,
   French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity,
   she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit
   and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to
   death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no
   reason why that can’t happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we
   go?

   Later.

   Howard: The thing to remember is you can go to outer space,
   too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those
   desks you’re sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.

   Girl: Did you go to the moon?

   Howard: No, but I did go to the International Space Station.

   Girl: Did you fly the rocket?

   Howard: No, but I was in the rocket. I didn’t actually…

   Girl: So you just flew around? That’s kind of like my uncle.
   He’s a flight attendant.

   Howard: No, I’m an American hero. Your uncle brings people
   nuts, okay?

   Leonard: Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here,
   huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what’s called an
   experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to
   test theories and work with lasers. Yes?

   Girl 2: How did you decide to become a scientist?

   Leonard: Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I’ve always been
   into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so
   I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a
   better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I
   was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but
   with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you
   laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided
   and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were
   misguided. That’s just a little freestyle.

   Scene: The library.

   Raj (by text): My dad’s a gynaecologist in India, so if you’re
   over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he’s at
   your cervix.

   Lucy(by text): That’s terrible. Your dad should be sent to the
   pun-itentiary.

   Raj (by text): That’s a fitting pun-ishment. I still don’t know
   what you do for a living.

   Lucy (by text): Web design.

   Raj (by text): Anything I might have seen?

   Lucy (by text): I don’t know. You ever look at porn Web sites?

   Raj (by text): No, never. What is porn?

   Lucy (by text): Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say
   prom Web sites.

   Raj (by text): Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns,
   it’s like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That
   was supposed to say, I like sports.

   Scene: The classroom.

   Leonard: I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet
   girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house
   and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal
   bumblebee?

   Howard: Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let’s get out of here.

   Sheldon: Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don’t know if women in
   general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the
   sciences, but it’s clear you young women here, today, have
   been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time,
   it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear
   about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I
   happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak
   to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr.
   Fowler, are you there?

   Amy (voice): We’re here.

   Sheldon: Thank you for taking time out of your very busy
   schedule to enlighten these young women.

   Amy: It’s our pleasure. I’m Dr. Fowler, and I’m a
   neuroscientist.

   Bernadette: And I’m Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I’m a
   microbiologist.

   Amy: The world of science needs more women, but from a young
   age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look
   than about the power of our minds.

   Bernadette: That’s true. Every one of you has the capacity to
   be anything you want to be.

   Penny: Unless you want to be Cinderella.

   Bernadette: Come at me. See what happens.

   Scene: The library.

   Raj (by text): This was really fun.

   Lucy : My battery’s dying, so I’m just gonna talk. Thanks for
   today. I’ve been trying to do more things that scare me, and
   coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really
   nice. So thanks, and, um, I’m gonna go. Maybe I could do one
   more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You
   know, if that’s okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.

   Raj: I’m counting that as foreplay.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: Bernie, I’m home. You have fun today?

   Bernadette: Yes, and I have a surprise for you.

   Howard: Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.

   Bernadette: Well, hello, Prince Charming.

   Howard: Milady.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: Hey, how was your… what?

   Penny: I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we
   all went to Disneyland and got… What are you doing?

   Leonard (undressing): Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake
   up.

   Sheldon: Heard you the first time.
