Series 2 Episode 01 – The Bad Fish Paradigm

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Leonard: So you see, what you’re eating is not technically
   yoghurt, because it doesn’t have enough live acidophilus
   cultures. It’s really just iced milk with carragenin added for
   thickness.

   Penny: Oh, that’s very interesting.

   Leonard: It’s also not pink and has no berries.

   Penny: Yeah, but it doesn’t really answer my question.

   Leonard: What was your question again?

   Penny: Do you want some.

   Leonard: Oh, right, no, I’m lactose intolerant.

   Penny: Right.

   Leonard: So, gas.

   Penny: Got it.

   Leonard: Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a
   wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its
   movement and shuffles Penny away.)

   Penny: What are you doing?

   Leonard: There was a draft.

   Penny: I didn’t feel a draft.

   Leonard: Why don’t we just go into your….

   Penny: Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow
   things down a little.

   Leonard: No, no, I didn’t mean to go into your apartment to… go
   fast.

   Penny: No, I know, I… I know what you meant, it’s just… it’s
   only our first date.

   Leonard: Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don’t we just figure
   out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then
   rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.

   Penny: Or we could just wing it.

   Leonard: That might work too.

   Penny: Goodnight Leonard.

   Leonard: Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.)

   Cut to inside the apartment.

   Raj: He’s coming. Screen saver.

   Howard: Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?

   Leonard: Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let
   them spy on me?

   Sheldon: They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete
   lack of interest in what you were doing.

   Howard: You should thank us. When future generations try to
   determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned,
   this right here is the black box.

   Leonard: What are you talking about, the date went fine.

   Raj: Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.

   Leonard: Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It’s
   like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow
   down and savour it.”

   Howard: No, it’s like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to
   slow down and spit it out.”

   Raj: You being the fish.

   Leonard: I’m not the fish.

   Howard: Oh really, did you make a second date.

   Leonard: Well, we sort of decided to wing it.

   Sheldon: Oh, even I know that’s lame.

   Leonard: Okay, alright, let’s assume your hypothesis. We went
   to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have
   possibly gone wrong.

    Howard: Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women
   off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to
   come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to
   know what I’m getting into.

   Leonard: I didn’t say anything like that.

   Howard: Good, ‘cos they don’t work.

   Raj: They also don’t care for it if you stare at them and
   hyperventilate. Sadly, that’s my home run swing.

   Leonard: Look, everything went fine. I didn’t even have to
   refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across
   the hall is into me.

   Howard: Let’s go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the
   goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no
   flushing of the chest.

   Raj: Nice close up, by the way.

   Sheldon: Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access,
   clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.

   Leonard: That’s not a bad sign.

   Sheldon: Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no
   dewlap enlargement.

   Raj: And the worst sign of all is, you’re here and not there.

   Leonard: I’m not there because I’m taking things slow. Which,
   by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And
   take down that camera.

   Raj: He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.

   Howard: Give him time.

   Credits sequence

   Scene: The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts.

   Penny (entering): Hi.

   Sheldon: Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on
   machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric
   softener too early in the cycle so I’d avoid using that for
   your delicates.

   Penny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once):
   Thanks.

   Sheldon: Oh, good Lord. Why don’t you just take your clothes
   down to the river and beat them with a rock?

   Penny: Sheldon, may I ask you a question?

   Sheldon: I would prefer that you not, but I won’t go so far as
   to forbid it.

   Penny: Alright, I heard yes, so… okay, here’s my question, has
   Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.

   Sheldon: Well I assume you’re not referring to digestive
   regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are
   inappropriate.

   Penny: No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who
   wasn’t a braniac?

   Sheldon: Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman
   who had a PhD in French Literature.

   Penny: How is that not a braniac?

   Sheldon: Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it
   was literature.

   Penny: So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he’ll
   eventually get bored with me.

   Sheldon: That depends.

   Penny: On what?

   Sheldon: Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: Do you speak Klingon?

   Penny: No.

   Sheldon: Do you know any card tricks?

   Penny: Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business
   being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so
   insecure that she lied to him about finishing community
   college.

   Sheldon: Why would you lie about that?

   Penny: Well, he was going on and on about this college and that
   grad school and I didn’t want him to think I was some stupid
   loser.

   Sheldon: You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community
   college graduate?

   Penny: You know, there are a lot of successful people in this
   country who are community college graduates.

   Sheldon: Yeah, but you were neither.

   Penny: Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot
   tell Leonard any of this.

   Sheldon: You’re asking me to keep a secret?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Sheldon: Well I’m sorry, but you would have had to express that
   desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose
   whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret
   keeping. You can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to
   be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial
   expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself
   have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.
   (Long pause.) It’s a joke. It relies on the hominymic
   relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic
   the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.

   Penny: Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will
   absolutely die of embarrassment.

   Sheldon: Physiologically impossible.

   Penny: Oh Sheldon, please, look, I’m asking you as a friend.

   Sheldon: So you’re saying that friendship contains within it an
   inherent obligation to maintain confidences?

   Penny: Well, yeah.

   Sheldon: Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I
   should have led with this, when did we become friends?

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: I.e, I couldn’t become Green Lantern unless I was
   chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up
   capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.

   Leonard: You could be Batman?

   Sheldon: Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I’m Batman. See.

   Penny (arriving): Hi guys.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Sheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably): Hi Penny.

   Leonard: Hey, Penny, if you’re not doing anything Friday night
   I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.

   Penny: Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on
   Friday.

   Leonard: What about Saturday?

   Penny: You know, I’m not sure, the manager hasn’t posted the
   schedule yet, how about I let you know.

   Leonard: Great. So you just let me know when you know. So… (she
   leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?

   Sheldon: Why are you asking me, I have no information about
   your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me,
   nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.)

   Leonard (chasing him): What does that mean?

   Sheldon: Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back
   channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.

   Leonard: No I didn’t.

   Sheldon: I just think you need to be careful how you phrase
   things, sir.

   Leonard: What’s going on with you?

   Sheldon: Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you
   insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing
   to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to
   whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.)

   Leonard: What’s wrong with your face?

   Sheldon: There’s no reason to bring my looks into this. Good
   day, Leonard.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: I said Good Day! (He leaves)

   Leonard: Good day?

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory

   Penny: Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and
   that’s served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup
   of the day…

   Sheldon (appearing behind her): You must release me from my
   oath.

   Penny: Sheldon, I’m working.

   Sheldon: Why don’t you take a minute to decide (leads her away)
   I can’t keep your secret Penny. I’m going to fold like an
   energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a
   renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.

   Penny: Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little
   secret?

   Sheldon: I’m constitutionally incapable. That’s why I was
   refused clearance for a very prestigious government research
   fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath
   a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers
   City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.

   Penny: Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating
   from community college. Okay?

   Sheldon: Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not
   forget. I haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my
   mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.

   Penny: Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so
   you’re just going to have to figure out a way to do it.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon (entering): Leonard, I’m moving out.

   Leonard: What do you mean, you’re moving out? Why?

   Sheldon: There doesn’t have to be a reason.

   Leonard: Yeah, there kind of does.

   Sheldon: Not necessarily. This is a classic example of
   munchausen’s trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a
   series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it
   tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it’s
   ultimately circular, i.e., I’m moving out because I’m moving
   out.

   Leonard: I’m still confused.

   Sheldon: Leonard, I don’t see how I could have made it any
   simpler.

   Howard (entering): Hey, qu’est q’wass up?

   Raj: We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised
   human cadavers.

   Howard: And some of those skinless chicks were hot.

   Sheldon: If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to pack.

   Howard: That’s kind of an overreaction to a little harmless
   necrophilia.

   Leonard: It’s not you, Howard, he says he’s moving out.

   Raj: What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness
   settings on the television?

   Leonard: No.

   Raj: Did you take a band aid off in front of him?

   Leonard: No.

   Howard: Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink,
   talk to him through the bathroom door?

   Raj: Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T
   in often?

   Leonard: No.

   Howard: Did you make fun of trains?

   Leonard: I didn’t do anything, he’s just gone insane.

   Raj: Well, we all knew this day was coming.

   Leonard: That was fast.

   Sheldon: It’s my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag.
   Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah
   Connor.

   Leonard: Where are you gonna live?

   Sheldon: Until I find a permanent place I will stay with
   friends.

   Howard: Bye (runs out.)

   Raj: Well you can’t stay with me, I have a teeny tiny
   apartment.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, but isn’t hosting guests an aspect of
   Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or
   sacrifices of the Hindu householder?

   Raj: I hate trains.

   Sheldon: Don’t be ridiculous, you love trains.

   Raj: Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. (Sheldon drops
   keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)

   Leonard: This could work.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Sheldon: This is a very old building.

   Raj: Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.

   Sheldon: Uh-oh.

   Raj: What?

   Sheldon: Don’t you worry about the residual radium from the
   luminous dials?

   Raj: Not until now.

   Sheldon: I can’t believe I didn’t bring my gieger counter. You
   know, I had it on my bed and I didn’t pack it.

   Raj: Well, if you’re not comfortable staying here, Sheldon…

   Sheldon: I’m kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was
   subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call
   that the, um, old switcheroo.

   Raj: Terrific.

   Sheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television): Is that
   woman Aishwarya Rai?

   Raj: Yes, isn’t she an amazing actress.

   Sheldon: Actually, I’d say she’s a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit.

   Raj: How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison
   Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.

   Sheldon: Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you. Obviously you’re
   not that familiar with Indian cinema.

   Scene: Howard’s house. The door rings.

   Howard: Who is it?

   Voice: Strippergram. (Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and
   Sheldon.)

   Raj: Tag. You’re it. (Runs away.)

   Howard: Shouldn’t you have put him in a brown paper bag and set
   him on fire?

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow
   up mattress on the floor.

   Sheldon: I’ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar
   support whatsoever.

   Howard: Maybe you’d be happier on a park bench?

   Sheldon: I don’t see any way to get a park bench in here.

   Howard: Do you want to switch?

   Sheldon: No, that’s fine. I’m perfectly comfortable sleeping on
   a bouncy castle.

   Howard: Get out of bed, we’re switching.

   Sheldon: Now, only if you want to.

   Howard: Just get in the bed!

   Howard’s mother (off): What’s going on? Are you boys
   roughhousing?

   Howard: We’re just talking ma.

   Howard’s mother: If you don’t settle down right now, I’m not
   going to let you have any more sleepovers.

   Howard: For God’s sake, ma, I’m 27 years old. It’s not even a
   school night! (To Sheldon) Comfy now?

   Sheldon: Meh. That poster of Halle Berry’s a little unnerving.

   Howard: So don’t look at it.

   Sheldon: She’s like my fourth favourite catwoman.

   Howard: No kidding?

   Sheldon: Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and
   then her.

   Howard: What about Lee Meriwether?

   Sheldon: Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.

   Howard: Well I’m glad that’s settled.

   Sheldon: That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman.
   There’s Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee
   Meriwether…

   Howard: Please, I’m begging you, go to sleep.

   Sheldon: I’m trying, I’m counting catwomen. She did make a fine
   mutant in the X-Men movies though.

   Howard: Oh for God’s sake.

   Sheldon: But she’s not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that
   would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X.
   Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the
   Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler,
   Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel….

   Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment. There is an urgent
   rapping at the door.

   Leonard: I’m coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside,
   wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.)

   Sheldon: Hey, there he is, there’s my old buddy-bud-bud.

   Leonard: What’s with him?

   Howard: Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn’t get to
   sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my
   mom’s valium in it. But he still wouldn’t shut up, so, tag,
   you’re it.

   Sheldon: I’m ba-ack!

   Leonard: I still don’t know why you left.

   Sheldon: I can’t tell you.

   Leonard: Why not.

   Sheldon: I promised Penny.

   Leonard: You promised Penny what?

   Sheldon: That I wouldn’t tell you the secret. Shhhhh!

   Leonard: What secret. Tell me the secret.

   Sheldon: Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we
   can’t tell Dad.

   Leonard: Not that secret, the other secret.

   Sheldon: I’m Batman. Shhhhh!

   Leonard: Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret,
   what was the secret.

   Sheldon: Okay, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell Leonard.

   Leonard: I promise.

   Sheldon: Penny lied about graduating from community college
   because she is afraid she’s not smart enough for Leonard.

   Leonard: So it’s nothing I did? It’s her problem?

   Sheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny.

   Leonard: Penny thinks I’m too smart for her, that’s ridiculous.

   Sheldon: I know, most of your work is extremely derivative.
   Don’t worry, that’s not a secret. Everybody knows.

   Scene: The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny’s door.

   Penny (opening door): Hi.

   Leonard: Yeah, hi, listen, I know what’s been bothering you
   about us, and I have the answer.

   Penny: What are you talking about.

   Leonard: First I want to say that it’s not Sheldon’s fault, he
   tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn’t drugged
   him he would have taken it to his grave.

   Penny: He told you?

   Leonard: Yes, but it’s okay. Now that we know what the problem
   is, there’s a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.)

   Penny: Pasadena city college?

   Leonard: A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man
   here’s playing hacky sack, and this girl’s going to be a
   paralegal.

   Penny: Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can’t date
   a girl without a fancy college degree.

   Leonard: Well, it’s really not that fancy, it’s just a city
   college.

   Penny: Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date
   you?

   Leonard: That doesn’t matter to me at all.

   Penny: So, it’s fine with you if I’m not smart.

   Leonard: Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay,
   this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the
   camera) Oh bite me!
