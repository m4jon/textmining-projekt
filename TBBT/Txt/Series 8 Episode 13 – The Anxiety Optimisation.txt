Series 8 Episode 13 – The Anxiety Optimisation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Okay, we’re headed out, see you later.

   Sheldon: Before you leave, could you test these
   noise-cancelling headphones?

   Leonard: Yeah, sure.

   Sheldon: Okay. Go ahead.

   Leonard: Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven’t changed the
   filter in the water pitcher in two years.

   Penny: Uh, Bernadette’s nickname for you is the virgin piña
   colada.

   Leonard: Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.

   Penny: Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I
   used your toothbrush.

   Leonard: Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally
   took off her… and that’s why you’re the best roommate ever.

   Sheldon: Aw, now I’m sad I didn’t hear it.

   Penny: So what do you need the headphones for?

   Sheldon: Well, I’ve been struggling for months to come up with
   a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay. I’m
   hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment.
   See, I’ve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping
   temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my
   tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this
   inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of
   physics renegade Richard Feynman.

   Penny: Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last
   night?

   Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it. There, the place is all
   yours.

   Penny: Yeah, have fun.

   Sheldon: Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting
   evening of science.

   Penny: And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.

   Leonard: Bye.

   Sheldon: Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time
   shift) Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay.
   Proton decay.

   Leonard: Hey, we’re home. Any progress?

   Sheldon: How could there be, with these constant interruptions?

   Penny: I love him, but if he’s broken, let’s not get a new one.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: What are you doing? It’s time to go.

   Sheldon: I’m not going to work today. And would you like to
   know why?

   Leonard: Ah, you’re upset because you spent the whole night
   working on dark matter and didn’t make a breakthrough, and now
   you’re worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and
   you’re gonna sit around and sulk all day?

   Sheldon: Like a big old baby.

   Leonard: Call me if you need anything.

   Sheldon: I’ve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need
   some fresh air.

   Penny (off): Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?

   Penny (off): Ugh!

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?

   Penny (off): Ugh!

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?

   Penny: Ugh, what?

   Sheldon: You sounded in distress. I was worried something
   unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous
   coitus with Leonard.

   Penny: Oh, I’m just doing this awful workout. I hate it.

   Sheldon: Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it?
   Although I could ask the same question about coitus with
   Leonard.

   Penny: I don’t know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me
   work harder.

   Sheldon: And to clarify?

   Penny: The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn’t you be getting ready
   for work?

   Sheldon: I’m not going. Would you like to know why?

   Penny: Uh, you’re sad about not getting anything done last
   night, so you’re gonna sit around and pout about it?

   Sheldon: Boy, I’m not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Howard: I invented a game. You want to play?

   Leonard: Sure.

   Howard: It’s called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes
   I’ve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his
   girlfriend or his dog.

   Raj: Go ahead, make fun. You can’t embarrass me, I’ve got a
   beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks
   my bathwater.

   Howard: Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want
   you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you’re not in it.

   Raj: I may not be liking this game so much.

   Leonard: Cinnamon. Give me another one.

   Howard: Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us
   matching sweaters.

   Leonard: We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.

   Raj: You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet.
   It’s not strange.

   Leonard: Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I
   thought you were staying home.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised
   something. I, first, she’s trying much harder to stay
   attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the
   reason I may not be progressing in my research is I’ve created
   too pleasant of an environment for myself.

   Howard: What do you mean?

   Sheldon: According to a classic psychological experiment by
   Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must
   create a state of productive anxiety. So I’d like to ask you
   all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me
   off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life
   miserable.

   Howard: Hold on. What’s in it for us?

   Sheldon: Well, I suppose…

   Howard: Okay, we’ll do it.

   Scene: Amy’s laboratory.

   Sheldon: Done.

   Amy: 33 seconds. Okay, that’ll be our baseline.

   Sheldon: You know, I don’t want to tell you how to do your job,
   but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.

   Amy: It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.

   Sheldon: And his last meal was a food pellet? You’re a monster.

   Amy: All right, next, we’re gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing
   stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects
   your problem-solving rate.

   Sheldon: Very well. And good luck, I’m a pretty laid-back guy.

   Amy: Ready? Begin. Why’d you pop it?

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, I was aiming for your heart.

   Amy: Look, I know you don’t like it, but that’s the point of
   the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal
   anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or
   watching me eat a banana.

   Sheldon: Who eats them horizontally?

   Amy: My mother said that’s how good girls do it.

   Sheldon: Perhaps this was a waste of time.

   Amy: Sheldon, you’re a remarkable scientist. Just be patient,
   I’m sure you’ll find the breakthrough you’ve been looking for.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Amy: And if you only do solid research instead of making a
   groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?

   Sheldon: Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and
   you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be…

   Amy: Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.

   Sheldon: Really? Oh, that’s fantastic. Now, wait, they’re
   dropping. Why are they dropping?

   Amy: Because you’re happy they’re elevated.

   Sheldon: Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up
   again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: All right, guys, what game do you want to play?

   Howard: Let’s see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?

   Raj: You know what? I think it’s a little weird that you
   remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you’re
   jealous of all my relationships.

   Howard: Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn’t want to be the girl, or
   possibly dog, to hear the words you’re so lucky, you have the
   shiniest hair.

   Leonard: That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of
   them.

   Sheldon: Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you
   to irritate me. I’d like you to be my intellectual sparring
   partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to
   challenge it.

   Leonard: So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Raj: And you think that’s going to help?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Howard: Well, I don’t think that’s gonna help at all.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I’ll
   become more focused.

   Leonard: Howard’s right, that’ll never work.

   Sheldon: Stop fighting me on the premise. It’s scientifically
   valid. I’m going to advance propositions, I just want you to
   challenge me.

   Raj: I don’t think that’s what you want at all.

   Sheldon: Why, of course it’s what I want. Why would I say it’s
   what I want if it’s not what I want?

   Leonard: Because it is what you want, and it’s not what you
   said.

   Sheldon: I ask you for one simple thing, and you can’t even do
   it.

   Howard: Yes, we can.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, then do it.

   Howard: Nah.

   Sheldon: You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was
   helpful.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter
   gets a trip for two to Hawaii.

   Amy: That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.

   Penny: Yeah, clearly you haven’t seen him on the beach walking
   around with his metal detector.

   Amy: If I were going to Hawaii, I’d spend all my time at the
   Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have
   better resolution than the Hubble?

   Penny: Really? Want to go to Hawaii?

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock)
   Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies?

   Penny: Come in.

   Sheldon: Ladies.

   Penny: What’s up?

   Sheldon: Well, as you may know, I’ve been experimenting with
   elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to
   increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of
   tasteless uncensored crotch talk?

   Penny: What exactly do you think goes on here?

   Sheldon: Well, conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable
   having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best
   cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men’s
   buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.

   Bernadette: We were talking about Penny’s job.

   Sheldon: And how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated,
   cranky and crampy? Continue.

   Penny: Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same
   things you guys talk about.

   Sheldon: You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard
   says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim
   before he was bitten. What do you think?

   Penny: Let’s just talk about our periods.

   Amy: No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim.
   Why wouldn’t a werewolf have the same abilities?

   Bernadette: Well, they’re not a hundred percent wolf. They’re a
   werewolf, that’s only part wolf. It’s like comparing apples to
   oranges.

   Sheldon: Thank you. Oh, and technically, it’s apples that turn
   into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We
   should do it sometime when you aren’t all PMS’ing. Bye.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: What is going on?

   Sheldon: Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level,
   so I’m using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla’s roar to
   keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift
   in the mix, but turns out I love her.

   Leonard: Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I’m
   trying to sleep. Good night.

   Sheldon: Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate,
   hate, hate.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Amy: You’ve been working so much lately, I’m glad you didn’t
   forget about date night.

   Sheldon: Of course.

   Amy: Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Yeah.

   Amy: Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.

   Sheldon: I can do both. My brain is working at optimal
   capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark
   matter proton decay problem at the same time.

   Amy: Fine. How was your day?

   Sheldon: Oh, you said it.

   Amy: Sheldon. Sheldon, I’m worried about you. You’re not
   eating, you haven’t slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap
   is starting to smell.

   Sheldon: I know. It’s replaced Godzilla as my principle source
   of anxiety.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: Okay, so it’s one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny,
   you’re the tiebreaker.

   Penny: Say the quote again.

   Howard: It’s just so perfect that we’re both Libras.

   Penny: Wow, this is hard. I’m gonna say Cinnamon.

   Howard: Yes.

   Penny: Yes.

   Raj: Come on.

   Howard: That was the last one, I promise. We won’t play any
   more.

   Raj: Thank you. ‘Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her
   feelings.

   Bernadette: Emily’s feelings?

   Raj: Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where’s Sheldon?

   Penny: Date night.

   Leonard: That can’t be much fun for Amy. You know, at work
   today, he tried his first Red Bull.

   Bernadette: What happened?

   Leonard: He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and
   then threw up in my car.

   Bernadette: Don’t you think you should make him stop all this?

   Howard: I don’t know, he’s not really hurting anybody.

   Leonard: You didn’t have to scoop vomit out of your glove
   compartment.

   Sheldon: He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty
   interesting take on proton decay.

   Raj: Wow, if he cracks that it’s a game changer, guys. It’ll
   completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.

   Howard: Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can
   such a little girl eat such a big steak?

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Amy: Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.

   Sheldon: That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if
   you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that’d really
   put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.

   Amy: I’m sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to
   date night.

   Sheldon: There you go, perfect.

   Amy: Sheldon, stop it, I’m not kidding. Take the cap off, and
   put the notebook away.

   Sheldon: But after months of struggling, I’m finally making
   progress.

   Amy: You don’t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be
   productive.

   Sheldon: Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia
   while convinced he was an armadillo.

   Amy: That’s not true.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn’t. I have been
   hallucinating lately.

   Amy: Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and
   take care of yourself.

   Sheldon: Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than
   I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop
   doing this, and it all goes away?

   Amy: Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your
   anxiety.

   Sheldon: Hmm, perhaps. But I’m not taking the cap off.

   Amy: It’s one thing to make yourself miserable, but you’re
   making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I’m telling you
   for the last time, take the cap off.

   Sheldon: Oh, really? What if I don’t? And before you answer
   that, can I have my dessert?

   Scene: A bus.

   Sheldon: And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend.
   When all I’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world
   we live in.

   Man: Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?

   Sheldon: I knew you’d understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Penny: Okay.

   Leonard: Here we are.

   Sheldon: Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of
   science isn’t in here.

   Leonard: You lie down, he’ll be here in a minute.

   Sheldon: Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.

   Penny: Now, you just get comfortable.

   Sheldon: No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what’s
   comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a
   panda bear with Richard Feynman’s face on it. Warm up the car,
   Leonard, it’s poster time.

   Leonard: Maybe in the morning.

   Penny: Yeah, you get some sleep.

   Sheldon: No, I don’t want to go to sleep, you can’t make me.

   Penny: You’re right, we can’t.

   Sheldon: Yeah, darn straight, you can’t. Try to tell a grown
   man to go to sleep.

   Penny (singing): Soft kitty, warm kitty.

   Leonard (singing): Little ball of fur.

   Sheldon: That’s not gonna work.

   Penny (singing): Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.

   Together (singing): Purr, purr, purr.

   Leonard: You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see
   him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would
   be to hold a pillow over his face.

   Penny: Mmmm.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Howard: You look like you got some rest.

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m feeling much better. And I’ve also been
   continuing to make progress without artificially raising my
   anxiety levels.

   Leonard: I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came
   out, so my levels, right up there.

   Raj: Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?

   Leonard: Yeah, sure.

   Howard: Yeah, no problem.

   Sheldon: Of course not.

   Emily: So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.

   Howard: Well, um, we were just kidding around.

   Emily: Well, you may think it’s funny that Raj is sweet and
   sensitive, but I think it’s sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in
   your mouth?
