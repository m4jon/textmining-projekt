Series 2 Episode 03 – The Barbarian Sublimation

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the sofa, using his laptop.
   He is wearing a headset.

   Sheldon: Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are
   about to enter Axel’s fortress. Now this is a long run, so
   let’s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we’ll wait for
   you again, but you really should see a doctor. (There is
   banging at the door.) Sheldor is AFK. (Goes out to find Penny
   having trouble getting into her apartment.) Penny, are you
   experiencing some sort of difficulty?

   Penny: Yes, I can’t get my stupid door open.

   Sheldon: You appear to have put your car key in the door lock,
   are you aware of that?

   Penny: Yeah!

   Sheldon: Alright then. (Turns to return inside. One of the
   grocery bags Penny is holding falls to the floor spilling
   groceries.)

   Penny: Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.

   Sheldon: Would it be possible for you to do this a little more
   quietly?

   Penny: I can’t get the damned key out.

   Sheldon: Well that’s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your
   door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key
   for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.

   Penny: Thankyou, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your
   car key in the door lock?

   Penny: Why? I’ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition,
   it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my
   turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too
   Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even
   mean?

   Sheldon: Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by
   Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a
   characteristic facial bone structure….

   Penny: I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have
   been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven’t got a
   single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven’t gotten
   a raise at work, haven’t even had sex in six months, and just
   now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth
   and I ate it.

   Sheldon: Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many
   cultures, they’re almost pure protein.

   Penny (picking up the bag she has just repacked, whereupon the
   bottom falls out and the groceries fall to the floor again):
   Oh, sonofabitch!

   Sheldon: I believe the condensation on your frozen foods
   weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to
   your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and
   have him open the door for you.

   Penny: I did, and he said he’ll get here when he gets here.

   Sheldon: And you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in
   the form of a meaningless tautology?

   Penny: No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything
   and my breath smells like fly. (Bursts into tears.)

   Sheldon: There there. (Reluctantly) Would you prefer to wait in
   our apartment?

   Penny: No Sheldon, I’d rather sit on this freezing cold floor
   sobbing like a three year-old.

   Sheldon: Alright then. (Turns to go inside again.)

   Penny: For God’s sake! (Stomps into apartment.)

   Sheldon: Just when I think I’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Inside the apartment.

   Sheldon: Make yourself comfortable. (Sits in Sheldon’s place.)
   Not there. (Sits on other end of sofa. Puts feet on table.
   Sheldon looks disapprovingly. Removes feet from table. Sheldon
   sits and replaces headset.) Sheldor is back online.

   Penny: Sheldor?

   Sheldon: The Conqueror.

   Penny: What are you doing?

   Sheldon: AFK. I’m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer
   game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard’s Conan the
   Barbarian.

   Penny: Oh.

   Sheldon: Sheldor, back online.

   Penny: What’s AFK?

   Sheldon: AFK. Away from keyboard.

   Penny: OIC.

   Sheldon: What does that stand for?

   Penny: Oh, I see?

   Sheldon: Yes, but what does it stand for?

   Scene: The stairwell. Leonard arrives and sees the spilled
   groceries. A cat is lapping at a spilled pot of ice-cream. Cut
   to inside. Penny now has the laptop, Sheldon is instructing
   her.

   Sheldon: Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.

   Penny: Oh, I don’t know. Can I see them in another colour?

   Sheldon: Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a
   level three warrior.

   Leonard: What’s going on?

   Penny: Leonard, guess what, I’m a level three warrior.

   Leonard: Great, you know there are groceries outside of your
   apartment?

   Penny: Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!

   Leonard: I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting
   and it’s starting to attract wildlife.

   Penny: Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the
   beach?

   Sheldon: It doesn’t matter, right now you’re looking for
   treasure.

   Penny: Okay. (Leonard motions for Sheldon to talk in the
   kitchen.) Wait, wait, where are you going?

   Sheldon: You’re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them
   with your boots.

   Leonard: Want to catch me up?

   Sheldon: Well let’s see, uh, she attempted to open her
   apartment with her car key, because her face is overly
   Midwestern, um, she hasn’t had sex in six months, and she ate a
   fly.

   Leonard: Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?

   Penny: Oh my God, a treasure chest, I’m rich!

   Sheldon: Level three and she thinks she’s rich! What a noob.

   Scene: The apartment. Raj is pouring a white liquid into the
   main dish of a stereo speaker covered in cling film.

   Raj: Okay, we’re all set.

   Howard: Let her rip.

   (Leonard turns on stereo with a remote. Rhythmic bass-heavy
   music plays. The liquid begins dancing on the speaker.)

   Penny (entering, carrying a laptop): Hi!

   Leonard: Hey, check it out, it’s just corn starch and water.

   Sheldon: They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid,
   but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.

   Howard: That’s what makes it get all funky.

   Penny: Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.

   Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): No, that’s what she
   said, Sheldon.

   Penny: Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring
   the Island of Tordage but I can’t figure out how to get past
   the guard captain.

   Sheldon: Do you have the enchanted sword?

   Penny: No, no, I’ve a bronze dagger.

   Sheldon: You can’t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger,
   my Lord it’s like the car key in your apartment door all over
   again.

   Penny: Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?

   Sheldon: Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?

   Penny: Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in
   front of it?

   Sheldon: No, no, no, it’s… oh for God’s sakes, gimme. (Takes
   laptop.)

   Penny: Thank you, I really appreciate this.

   Sheldon: You’re going to have to learn to do these things for
   yourself, Penny.

   Penny: Don’t patronise me, just get the sword.

   Howard: What the frak?

   Leonard: Beats me. They were playing all last night too.

   Raj: It’s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.

   Howard: Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.

   Raj: I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?

   Leonard: No, that’s Marcie. Peppermint Patty’s just athletic.

   Sheldon: There you go, one enchanted sword.

   Penny: Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard
   captain. (Leaves).

   Sheldon: That girl needs to get a life.

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom. There is a knock on the door. Penny
   enters.

   Penny (whispering): Sheldon. (Sing-song) Shel-don.

   Sheldon: Danger, danger.

   Penny: No danger, look, it’s just me, Penny, look, I got to
   level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?

   Sheldon: You’re in my bedroom.

   Penny: Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.

   Sheldon: People can’t be in my bedroom.

   Penny: Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?

   Sheldon: I’m not wearing pyjama bottoms.

   Penny: Why not?

   Sheldon: I spilled grape juice.

   Penny: Well, wear different pyjamas.

   Sheldon: I can’t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday
   pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.

   Penny: Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to
   the Black Castle?

   Sheldon: You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?

   Penny: Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I’m just not sure
   it’s the right move for my character.

   Sheldon: Of course it’s not, you’re only a level 25, the
   Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.

   Penny: Really? Boy, you’d think you could trust a horde of
   Hungarian barbarians.

   Cut to Leonard, exiting his bedroom.

   Sheldon (off): Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.

   Penny (off): Okay, well you were great, thanks. (Comes out
   door) Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don’t got in Sheldon’s room,
   he’s not wearing bottoms.

   Leonard (knocking on door): Sheldon, you want to catch me up
   again?

   Scene: Dr Gablehauser’s office. Sheldon and Leslie are standing
   across the desk.

   Gablehauser: People, I am very busy today.

   Sheldon: I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as
   head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental
   disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection
   two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.

   Gablehauser: Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call
   Dr Cooper this time?

   Leslie: Dr Dumbass.

   Gablehauser: Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.

   Sheldon: No she doesn’t.

   Leslie: No I don’t.

   Sheldon: Here’s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the
   mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped
   the sign-up sheet off the wall.

   Leslie: It wasn’t even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it
   himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six
   months.

   Sheldon: If it is a crime to ensure that the universities
   resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild
   geese then I plead guilty. (His phone rings.) Oh, Penny!

   Gablehauser: You need to get that Dr Cooper?

   Sheldon: God, no.

   Leslie: Well don’t turn it off, you might miss your call from
   the Nobel committee letting you know you’ve been nominated as
   dumbass laureate of the year.

   Sheldon: Oh yeah, well, you wouldn’t even be nominated. Dr
   Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit
   calculations and simulations to run. All she’s doing is
   reducing irrelevant data and making a mock…

   Gablehauser (as phone rings): Excuse me. Gablehauser. (Holding
   phone out to Sheldon) It’s for you.

   Sheldon: Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you,
   you’re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need
   to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one
   should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can’t log on and help
   you. We’ll talk when I get home. (Puts phone down) I’m not
   getting the computing time, am I?

   Leslie: Dumbass.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon enters.

   Sheldon: Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is
   interfering with my sleep, she’s interfering with my work, and
   if I had another significant aspect of my life, I’m sure she’d
   be interfering with that too.

   Leonard: Why should I do something, you’re the one who
   introduced her to online gaming.

   Sheldon: Well, yes, but you’re the one who said hello to her
   when she moved in. If you’d simply restrained yourself none of
   this would be happening.

   Leonard: Why don’t you just tell her to leave you alone.

   Sheldon: I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very
   emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon
   Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don’t know what
   else to do.

   Leonard: Well, what am I supposed to do?

   Sheldon: I don’t know, but if you don’t figure something out, I
   warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.

   Leonard: You mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the
   happy funtime Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Yes.

   Leonard: I’ll go talk to her.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment. She is on her laptop and talking into
   a headset.

   Penny: No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don’t know
   German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!

   Leonard (knocking and entering): Hey Penny.

   Penny: Busy.

   Leonard: Yeah, I see that. Shouldn’t you be at work?

   Penny: I don’t work on Mondays.

   Leonard: It’s Thursday. Listen, Penny.

   Penny: Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?

   Leonard: Okay, um, here’s the thing, um, sometimes people, good
   people, you know, they start playing these games and they find
   themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of,
   addicted.

   Penny: Yeah, get to the point, I’m about to level up here.

   Leonard: Well, i-i-i-it’s just if a person doesn’t have a sense
   of achievement in their real life it’s easy to lose themselves
   in a virtual world where they get a false sense of
   accomplishment.

   Penny: Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope’s
   back online.

   Leonard: Penny, you’ve got cheetos in your hair.

   Penny (pulling cheeto out of hair): Oh, thanks. (Eats it.)

   Leonard: Wow.

   Scene: Same – later. Penny is attacking a multi-headed monster
   with a sword on the screen.A muscular warrior in a cape walks
   onto the screen.

   Warrior: Hey Penny, it’s me again, Leonard.

   Penny- warrior: Leonard, I said not now.

   Leonard-warrior: Yeah, I know, I’m just a little concerned
   about you.

   Penny-warrior: I said not now. (Chops off his head.)

   Leonard-warrior’s head: Okay, maybe later.

   Scene: The university lunch room.

   Raj: Hey guys.

   Leonard and Howard: Hey.

   Raj (indicating Sheldon): Hey, what’s with him?

   Leonard: Penny’s been keeping him up at night.

   Howard: Me too. But probably in a different way.

   Leonard: She’s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she’s
   playing non-stop.

   Raj: Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There’s nothing worse
   than having that multi-player monkey on your back.

   Leonard: Sheldon, wake up.

   Sheldon: Danger, danger.

   Leslie (arriving): Afternoon men. Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by
   excluding me from the set of adult males…. oh, I’m too tired to
   do this.

   Leslie: Right, I heard you’ve been pulling all nighters with
   middle-earth Barbie.

   Sheldon: She comes into my room. No-one’s supposed to be in my
   room.

   Leslie: Well, I would postulate that she’s escaping into the
   online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.

   Howard: I do that too. But probably in a different way.

   Leonard: That’s not what she’s doing, Leslie, she’s just trying
   to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.

   Leslie: Everything has to do with sex.

   Howard: Mmmm, testify. (Puts up hand for a handslap.)

   Leslie: I’m not touching that.

   Leonard: Leslie, you are way off base here.

   Sheldon: Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie
   as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to
   concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of
   promiscuity and general sluttiness.

   Leslie: Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to
   get her some.

   Sheldon: Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.

   Howard: I’ll take the bullet.

   Leonard: Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.

   Sheldon: Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I’m going to take action.
   (Leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table.) Excuse
   me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?

   Man: No.

   Sheldon: Would you like to be?

   Man: Uh, sure, why not?

   Leonard: Sheldon…

   Sheldon: Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?

   Man: Uh… (checks out Sheldon’s package) Yeah, yeah. (Pulls out
   pen and writes it on Sheldon’s hand.)

   Sheldon: There, problem solved.

   Leslie: Dumbass.

   Scene: Penny’s flat. Penny is on her laptop. Everything around
   her is littered with empty food packaging and red bull cans.
   She burps loudly. Sheldon is sitting on the sofa.

   Penny: Okay, I’m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients,
   I’m going in.

   Sheldon: Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.

   Penny: Got it.

   Sheldon: I must say, you’re playing very well for a woman of
   23?

   Penny: 22.

   Sheldon: Right. 22. (Cut to his screen, he is filling in an
   online dating profile.)

   Penny: Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The
   hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?

   Sheldon: What happened to the rest of your group?

   Penny: I dumped them, they’re a bunch of wussies.

   Sheldon: Frenzy stance.

   Penny: Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!

   Sheldon: So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a
   wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up
   with a good book?

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: These are market research questions. I’m filling out
   the online registration for your game.

   Penny: Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn’t
   working, die you undead mummy, die!

   Sheldon: Drink a healing potion.

   Penny: Thank you.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1
   being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by
   you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?

   Penny: That’s on the registration?

   Sheldon: Oh yes, it’s quite extensive. But if we complete it,
   we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.

   Penny: Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I’m a big
   old five.

   Sheldon: Good to know. Big old five.

   Scene: The apartment. Leonard enters. There is a strange man
   sitting on the sofa.

   Leonard: Hello.

   Man: Hi.

   Sheldon: Leonard, this is Tom.

   Leonard: Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn’t I explain to you about your
   little mistake in the cafeteria?

   Sheldon: Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the
   table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable
   mate for Penny.

   Leonard: Chosen by science?

   Sheldon: Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They
   claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.

   Leonard: You got Penny to sign up for online dating?

   Sheldon: No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.

   Leonard: This is bad.

   Sheldon: Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he’s
   going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and,
   uh, strong women who initiate sex.

   Leonard: Really, really bad.

   Sheldon: I’m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently
   she’s a big old five.

   Penny (entering, looking ratty in baggy clothes and with her
   hair unwashed): Sheldon, what do you want.

   Sheldon: Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I’d like you to meet
   Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.

   Tom: Hi Penny.

   Penny: Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I’m here, I’m on a quest
   with a bunch of noobs, they don’t know what they’re doing,
   we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.

   Sheldon: Can we talk about this later.

   Penny: No, no, no, no, I need you now.

   Sheldon: But wouldn’t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is
   a sexually passive outdoorsman.

   Penny: Whatever, I’ll figure it out myself.

   Tom: Bye, Penny. I’m sorry, dude, she didn’t look anything like
   her picture.

   Leonard: They never do.

   Scene: Inside the game. Penny-warrior is standing next to a
   battle horse.

   Warrior: Hello, fair Penny.

   Penny-warrior: Who are you?

   Warrior: It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in
   an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale
   at yon virtual tavern?

   Penny-warrior: Yeah, sure, why not?

   Penny: Oh my God, I need help. (Closes laptop and throws it
   away.)
