Series 6 Episode 09 – The Parking Spot Escalation

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Leonard: They are not.

   Raj: They are, too.

   Leonard: Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the
   data. You’re just clinging to it out of intellectual
   stubbornness.

   Raj: No, you’re displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject
   matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.

   Raj: That’s called a fashion choice.

   Leonard: All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get
   him.

   Sheldon: If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie.
   However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo
   with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that’s been eaten from
   the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.

   Leonard: Good boy. Here’s a cookie.

   Sheldon: Oh, thank you.

   Howard: Hey, fellas, what’s going on?

   Leonard: Oh, mummies and zombies again.

   Howard: Oh, they’re not the same thing.

   Leonard: You get a cookie, too.

   Howard: Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?

   Raj: Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?

   Howard: Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If
   you want to check it out later, it’s parked right out front,
   space 294.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, 294?

   Howard: Yeah.

   Sheldon: That’s my parking spot.

   Raj: Why do you have a parking spot? You don’t have a car. You
   don’t even drive.

   Sheldon: It doesn’t matter. That’s my spot.

   Leonard: Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.

   Sheldon: Well, I’m not using my nipples, either. Maybe they
   should reassign those.

   Howard: Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I’m sure they’ll
   give you another parking space.

   Sheldon: I don’t want another parking space. I want my parking
   space. It’s perfect. It’s a corner spot, cutting the risk of
   door-dings in half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building
   entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is
   also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because
   most squirrels are real jerks.

   Howard: Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don’t have a car.

   Sheldon: Don’t try to change the subject. This is about a
   parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.

   Howard: Are you listening to yourself?

   Sheldon: I always listen to myself. It’s one of the great joys
   of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.

   Howard: Nope.

   Sheldon: Very well. You leave me no choice.

   Scene: The parking spot. Sheldon is trying to push Howard’s car
   out of the spot.

   Sheldon: What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon (on phone): President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah,
   I understand I don’t use the parking spot, but that’s not the
   point. I… Yes, I’m aware you told me not to call you at home,
   but you didn’t answer the door. And I know you were there,
   because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that’s
   some salty language. May I remind you that you’re the president
   of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth
   Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that
   mouth? Oh, well, I’m sorry for your loss. Good night, sir.
   Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he’s a
   high-profile asset to the university.

   Leonard: Well, he’s not wrong. Howard did go to the
   International Space Station.

   Sheldon: Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he
   gonna milk that cow?

   Leonard: Sheldon, let it go. It’s not a big deal.

   Sheldon: No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts
   with a parking space, where does it end? It’s like my dad
   always said, first they say you can’t drink and drive, next
   thing you know, you can’t let your 10-year-old take the wheel
   while you sleep one off in the backseat.

   Leonard: All that story does is make me feel bad for your
   mother.

   Sheldon: Leonard, you’re my best friend. Why don’t you ever
   take my side?

   Leonard: Because I can never understand your side.

   Scene: Sheldon’s office.

   Howard: Give it back.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, but could you be more specific?

   Howard: My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give
   it back.

   Sheldon: Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren’t
   using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now.
   Payback, it truly is the B word, isn’t it?

   Howard: Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition
   collectible, and I want it back.

   Sheldon: I’d love to help you out, but unfortunately (puts
   helmet on), I’m using it.

   Howard: Fine. I’m taking your diploma.

   Sheldon: Go ahead. That’s the only doctorate you’ll ever get.
   It smells funny in here.

   Scene: The apartment stairwell.

   Bernadette: We’re so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.

   Penny: Yeah. So, how you doing?

   Amy: A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that
   long?

   Penny: Uh, no, they usually don’t have to go out and get more
   wax.

   Amy: I feel like I’m five pounds lighter.

   Bernadette: Really? Only five?

   Penny: Hey, anybody want a drink?

   Amy: Sure.

   Bernadette: Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about
   this silly parking space fight, too?

   Amy: For hours. Fortunately, I couldn’t understand most of it
   ’cause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.

   Bernadette: Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in
   his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.

   Amy: I guess this is what we get for being with two
   testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they’re bound
   to lock horns.

   Penny: I’m assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at
   Comic-Con?

   Bernadette: I’m really sorry they took Sheldon’s spot away. He
   shouldn’t have to suffer just because Howard’s such a big deal
   now.

   Amy: I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little
   moment in the sun.

   Bernadette: What’s that supposed to mean?

   Amy: Well, I mean, Howard’s never gonna go to space again, but
   Sheldon will always be a genius.

   Bernadette: You’re right. And I’m sure Sheldon will get a fancy
   parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile
   contribution to science.

   Amy: If and when?

   Penny: Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how
   are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?

   Bernadette: Hang on. None of Sheldon’s theories have ever been
   definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.

   Amy: That’s an impressive accomplishment. He’s now an
   inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don’t have to
   be special or even qualified to go into space.

   Penny: You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax.
   My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It’s a bad
   idea.

   Bernadette: Gosh, Amy. I’m sensing a little hostility. Is it
   maybe because, like Sheldon’s work, your sex life is also
   theoretical?

   Penny: Damn.

   Amy: Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won’t
   be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly
   veiled reference to Howard’s lifelong obsession to crawl back
   into her spacious womb.

   Penny: Anyway, to this day, I still can’t see a box of crayons
   without crossing my legs.

   Bernadette: I don’t have to take this. I’m gonna go home and
   have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I’ll let him do it to
   me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn’t mean
   it that way,

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Raj: Okay, here’s another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and
   the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a
   zombie? Or a zompire?

   Leonard: Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Cookie.

   Leonard: I don’t have any.

   Sheldon: Well, I’m not giving it away. (Enters apartment.
   Howard is sitting naked in his spot with a laptop on his lap)

   Howard: Hi Sheldon.

   Sheldon: He’s in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in
   my spot.

   Leonard: Howard, what are you doing?

   Howard: He wasn’t using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of
   leather to wiggle my naked ass on.

   Sheldon: Get off there.

   Howard: Give me back my Iron Man helmet.

   Sheldon: Give me back my parking space.

   Howard: You don’t need a parking space. You don’t have a car.

   Sheldon: You don’t need an Iron Man helmet. You’re not Iron
   Man.

   Howard: Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you
   know, I have to say, I thought you’d be more upset that your
   laptop is sitting on my junk.

   Raj: I didn’t pick up on that. That’s a nice touch.

   Leonard: Mmm.

   Scene: The parking spot. Sheldon is spraypainting out Howard’s
   name and replacing it with his own.

   Amy: This is so exciting. I’m feeling all tingly. Although that
   could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.

   Sheldon: Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus
   security. They will not hesitate to scold us.

   Amy: Freaking pigs.

   Sheldon: Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and
   let’s get out of here.

   Amy: Wait, I’m leaving my car here?

   Sheldon: Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake.
   Really makes these things tough to budge.

   Amy: Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you
   something I had done today.

   Sheldon: All right, colour me intrigued.

   Amy: What do you think?

   Sheldon: I think you’re high on paint fumes. And boy, that’s a
   lot of Band-Aids.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Penny: Okay, Howard’s mother is in, like, every one of your
   wedding photos.

   Bernadette: What can I tell ya? She’s a big girl. Wherever you
   look, there she is. More coffee?

   Penny: No, Leonard’s taking me to a physics lecture, and
   coffee’ll just keep me awake. (Knock on door) Oh, I’ll get it.

   Amy: Oh, looks like someone’s on Team Bernadette. Where’s
   Howard?

   Bernadette: He’s not here. What’s wrong?

   Amy: He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get
   it back.

   Bernadette: Oh, no. Where was it parked?

   Amy: In Sheldon’s spot.

   Bernadette: That doesn’t make sense. Sheldon doesn’t have a
   spot. Was it maybe in Howard’s spot?

   Amy: Don’t play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he
   owes me two hundred dollars.

   Bernadette: Well, that doesn’t make sense, either.

   Amy: Why not?

   Bernadette: Because I’m the one who had it towed.

   Amy: You?

   Bernadette: Didn’t see that one coming, did ya?

   Amy: Oh, yeah? Well, you’re not gonna see this coming. (Swings
   handbag. Bernadette ducks. Penny is hit in the face)

   Penny: Ow! Ow!

   Amy: Oh, my God,

   Bernadette: Are you okay?!

   Penny: You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!

   Amy: Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I’ve
   been meaning to take to the bank.

   Bernadette: Don’t move. I’ll get some ice.

   Amy: Are you okay?

   Penny: Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what’s
   left of your pubes!

   Bernadette: Here.

   Penny: Thanks. Ah!

   Bernadette: Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out
   of hand?

   Penny: Gee, you think?

   Amy: I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.

   Bernadette: You hit her! What did I do?

   Amy: You had my car towed.

   Bernadette: You were parked in Howard’s spot.

   Amy: I was parked in Sheldon’s spot.

   Bernadette: Sheldon doesn’t have a spot.

   Penny: Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.

   Bernadette: Okay, let’s go.

   Amy: I’ll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my
   car.

   Bernadette: The tow truck didn’t scratch your car.

   Amy: How do you know?

   Bernadette: ‘Cause I did it!

   Scene: The parking spot. Sheldon has set up his office in it.

   Sheldon: Morning, Professor Stevens. Don’t look at that
   whiteboard. That’s my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.

   Howard: What the hell are you doing?

   Sheldon: Oh. You said I’m not using my space, so I’m using it.

   Howard: Okay, you need to move now.

   Sheldon: No, I don’t.

   Howard: You can’t stay there forever.

   Sheldon: Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg
   that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You’ve chosen to tangle
   with a superior intellect you can’t defeat. There is nothing
   you could possibly do to… (Howard starts sounding his horn.
   Sheldon puts on earphones)

   Howard: Those aren’t gonna help you, Sheldon,

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?

   Howard: I’m warning you, Sheldon!

   Sheldon: Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. (Howard
   starts pushing his chair with the front of the car) Stop that.

   Howard: Get out of my spot.

   Sheldon: No. That’s it. I am calling campus security. You
   prepare for the scolding of your life.

   Leonard: What are you idiots doing?

   Sheldon: He’s trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock
   music have desensitized him to violence.

   Howard: Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic
   roommate?

   Leonard: You’re both acting like lunatics. It’s just a parking
   spot.

   Howard: It’s not just a parking spot. He can’t handle the fact
   that I’m a bigger deal than he is now.

   Sheldon: Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for
   this university’s six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have
   changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I
   am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending
   machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating
   around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I
   have work to do.

   Howard: Can you believe this guy?

   Leonard: What I don’t believe is that you tried to run him
   over.

   Howard: Oh, like you’ve never thought of doing that. Don’t hate
   me just because I lived the dream. (Horn beeps. Sheldon is
   sitting naked in Howard’s car.)

   Sheldon: Hey, sweet ride.

   Howard: What are you doing in there?

   Sheldon: Just breaking in your new car.

   Howard: Stop that. You stop that.

   Sheldon: You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served
   nude.

   Scene: Sheldon’s office.

   Raj: Hey, got a minute?

   Sheldon: Oh, of course, come in. (Raj opens door to reveal
   Howard) This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must
   warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.

   Raj: Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.

   Howard: All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the
   parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy
   bastard…

   Raj: Howard, that’s not how we practiced it.

   Howard: I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway,
   I called President Siebert and told him it’s not worth fighting
   over the spot, so you keep it, and I’ll park in the structure
   across the street.

   Sheldon: Well, Howard, thank you. It’s quite a gesture on your
   part. You’ve shown yourself to be the bigger man.

   Howard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the
   bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I
   learn to drive or get a Batmobile.

   Howard: Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don’t know what to say.

   Sheldon: There is nothing to say. Except I’m the bigger man.
   I’m not kidding. Say it.

   Raj: Just say it.

   Howard: You’re the bigger man, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you
   wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.

   Scene: The cheesecake factory.

   Howard: I’d like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.

   Sheldon: To burying the hatchet.

   Bernadette: You know, I’m kind of glad this happened.

   Amy: Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought
   us closer.

   Penny (with two black eyes and a plaster across her nose):
   Yeah, everybody’s happy, great.

   Scene: A dry cleaners.

   Shopkeeper: Can I help you?

   Sheldon: Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you
   had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of
   leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have
   a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge
   wiggle.

   Shopkeeper: A what?

   Sheldon: A naked man sat on it. Now, here’s my concern, his
   diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to
   detect lipid residue?

   Shopkeeper: Lipid what?

   Sheldon: Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling
   card, if you will.

   Shopkeeper: Tuesday okay?

   Sheldon: Don’t rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a
   molecular level.

   Shopkeeper: Let me write you a ticket.

   Sheldon: Is that your son?

   Shopkeeper: Uh-huh.

   Sheldon: Looks like that laptop’s seen better days. If you’re
   interested, I’m selling this. It’s only two years old, 16
   gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally
   guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an
   astronaut’s penis.

   Perhaps if you get some use out of it, you could chuck me a few
