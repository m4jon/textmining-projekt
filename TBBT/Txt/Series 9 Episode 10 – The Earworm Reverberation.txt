Series 9 Episode 10 – The Earworm Reverberation

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper’s descent into madness, day two. It’s
   2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination
   time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night,
   struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It’s only
   a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I
   suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.

   Scene: The apartment. 2 days earlier.

   Leonard: Since when do you hum songs?

   Sheldon: What are you talking about?

   Leonard: You were just humming.

   Sheldon: Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets
   moving, it makes noise.

   Leonard: How does your brain feel about calculating the surface
   tension of the domain walls?

   Sheldon: Let’s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for
   Hufflepuff. What song is that?

   Leonard: Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?

   Sheldon (singing): Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.

   Leonard: Whatever. Can we just get back to this?

   Sheldon: I feel like I know what song that is, but I can’t put
   my finger on it. (Singing) My country, ’tis of thee. No.

   Leonard: It’s just an earworm. It’ll come to you.

   Sheldon: Okay. (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.

   Leonard: Is this what we’re doing the rest of the night?

   Sheldon (singing): I’m surprised you have to ask.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon (on phone): Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me.
   What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don’t know?
   Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of
   Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of
   Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.

   Leonard: Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good
   customer service.

   Penny: Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens
   to everybody.

   Sheldon: Well, I’m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I
   should be able to remember what song this is, but I can’t.
   Something’s wrong with me.

   Penny: I told you if we were patient, he’d figure it out for
   himself.

   Sheldon: I was always afraid this day would come. This might be
   the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually
   test the limits of public nudity.

   Penny: Public nudity?

   Leonard: Eh, that just means going barefoot.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Dave (voice on phone): Hello?

   Amy: Hi, Dave. Uh, it’s Amy.

   Dave: Oh. How are you?

   Amy: I’m fine. How are you?

   Dave: Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you,
   given how I acted on our last date.

   Amy: Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the
   last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was
   Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.

   Dave: So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

   Amy: Well, I was wondering if you’d like to get dinner again
   sometime.

   Dave: Yes, please.

   Amy: Great.

   Dave: Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem
   like a man with things on his schedule.

   Amy: How ’bout Saturday?

   Dave: Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers’ market with Jay
   Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Raj: Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there’s a
   Department for Outer Space Affairs?

   Howard: Really? Why?

   Raj: They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien
   civilization.

   Howard: Mm, boy, that’s one of those jobs that’s boring,
   boring, boring, then, oh, God, where’s the memo with what we do
   now?

   Raj: Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page
   on Facebook for our band and…

   Howard: Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting
   me?

   Raj: It’s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to
   set up.

   Howard: That’s not the point. When we created Footprints on the
   Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now
   you’re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know,
   maybe I should go solo.

   Raj: But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.

   Howard: All right. This thing’s bigger than you and me, band’s
   back together.

   Raj: So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the
   comic book store. You guys rock. And then there’s an animated
   smiley face raising the roof like this.

   Howard: We did raise the roof that night.

   Raj: Yeah, we totally did.

   Howard: Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon (singing): Why can’t I recall this song? This is taking
   far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again
   and again and again and again and again is strong.

   Leonard: Put on some headphones.

   Sheldon (singing): No they make my earlobes sweat.

   Penny: Hey, sweetie, why don’t you take a break and do
   something else for a while?

   Sheldon: There was a project I’ve been thinking about starting.

   Penny: Okay, great. What is it?

   Sheldon: I’ll show you. (Into phone camera) Dear Crazy Future
   Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once
   your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys.
   So, I’m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh,
   first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn
   us, but we wouldn’t listen. Oh, wait. (Singing) Everyody cut
   footloose. Nope.

   Penny: I’ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.

   Sheldon: This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you
   food, it’s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Bernadette: So, you’re really going out with Dave again?

   Amy: Why not? He’s actually a very nice guy.

   Bernadette: But he spent an entire date talking about how much
   he loves Sheldon.

   Amy: That’s nothing Sheldon hasn’t done before. Dave’s just a
   big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn’t bring it up
   again.

   Bernadette: Okay. So where’s he taking you?

   Amy: Oh, he’s coming here. I’m actually making dinner.

   Bernadette: Oh. That’s a big step.

   Amy: It is?

   Bernadette: Yeah. You’re inviting him into your home. It’s
   intimate. It’s where your underpants live.

   Amy: You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with
   Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what
   I need.

   Bernadette: You sure? You’ve never really been with a man. Do
   you really want to start with one that’s six-foot-seven?

   Amy: Why not?

   Bernadette: ‘Cause it’s like taking your driver’s test in a
   bus.

   Scene: Howard’s workshop.

   Raj: Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank
   him.

   Howard: What should we write?

   Raj: How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on
   the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.

   Howard: Someday you’re gonna make an amazing grandma.

   Raj: Well what do you want to write?

   Howard: Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin’
   our vibe. We’ll keep rockin’ if you keep rollin’.

   Raj: Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I’d throw it at your head
   right now.

   Howard: I’ll keep rockin’. You don’t do that.

   Raj: Okay. I posted it.

   Howard: So, who is this guy?

   Raj: Let’s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.

   Howard: Cool name.

   Raj: Yeah. He’s 24. He’s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He’s
   got awesome tattoos. Dude, he’s got a hot girlfriend, too.

   Howard: Damn. I don’t know if he’s our biggest fan or I’m his.
   Hey, Trent just liked our comment.

   Raj: He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I’m throwing my
   hypothetical bra at him.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Sheldon is playing his tune on a
   keyboard in the background.

   Penny: Oh, my God, he won’t stop.

   Leonard: How does he keep coming up with new ways to be
   annoying?

   Penny: Nobody knows. That’s why he’s number one. Can you please
   go talk to him?

   Leonard: Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it
   for once.

   Penny: Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?

   Leonard: What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.

   Penny: Fine.

   Leonard: I love you.

   Penny: Who cares?

   Sheldon (off): What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That’s
   mine. Why are you so strong?

   Penny: Problem solved.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It
   controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is
   72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A
   straitjacket, ’cause 72’s the best and you’re crazy. Now, this
   is your spot. You’re very protective of it. When anyone else
   tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds
   mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also
   delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no
   idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn’t replace it with
   Folger’s crystals, I’ll tell you that much.

   Leonard: Hey, can we please get back to work?

   Sheldon: This is Leonard. He’s your best friend in the world.

   Leonard: All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.

   Sheldon: Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with
   your life. And he does more things for you than I can even
   begin to list.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, he’s drinking it.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.

   Howard: Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.

   Raj: That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than
   new things that work.

   Bernadette: Who’s Trent?

   Howard: Oh, he’s our fan.

   Bernadette: Fan of what?

   Howard: Uh, did you forget? We’re in a band.

   Bernadette: You mean because you played one time in the comic
   book store?

   Howard: And at the children’s hospital until they asked us to
   leave.

   Raj: Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on
   Fair Oaks.

   Howard: Really? You want to go down there and meet him?

   Bernadette: Are you stalking him? That’s creepy.

   Raj: It’s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan
   page, Trent joined it.

   Howard: After that, all I did was check out his profile, go
   back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter
   handle.

   Raj: From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat
   and pretty much track his every movement.

   Howard: So if you think that’s creepy, you married the wrong
   guy.

   Bernadette: Maybe I should marry Trent.

   Raj: Yeah, like she could get Trent.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Dave: This is delicious.

   Amy: Thank you.

   Dave: Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.

   Amy: When you were married, did your wife cook?

   Dave: Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with
   a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.

   Amy: So, a little silver lining.

   Dave: I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a
   shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How
   long have you, uh, lived here?

   Amy: Uh, about five years. I’m actually thinking of moving to a
   better place now that I don’t need to be so close to, well, you
   know.

   Dave: I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in
   the area, not that I care.

   Amy: Yeah. Anyway, he doesn’t drive, so, I pretty much had to
   take him everywhere.

   Dave: Had to or got to? Sorry.

   Amy: My fault. I brought him up.

   Dave: Yeah. Well, let’s change the subject. No more mentions of
   you-know-who. That’s a cool train. Where did you get that?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never
   going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so
   relentlessly irritating?

   Leonard: That’s a trick question, right?

   Sheldon: Well, I shouldn’t be surprised. There’s a rich history
   of brilliant minds descending into madness.

   Penny: Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who
   don’t have mental problems.

   Leonard: Yup, she’s right. For every Newton who had a
   psychological issue, there’s an Edison who was just a jerk.
   That could totally be you.

   Sheldon: Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a
   volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla
   fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.

   Penny: Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.

   Sheldon: The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van
   Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of
   the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember
   the song. It’s called Darlin’ by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank
   goodness. I’m not crazy. I don’t have to take a pigeon as my
   bride.

   Leonard: There goes our shot at him living on the roof.

   Scene: A coffee shop.

   Raj: So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce
   ourselves?

   Howard: No. Let him spot us.

   Raj: I wonder if he’s listening to our music right now.

   Howard: Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He’s
   playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite
   two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.

   Raj: And he’s, all, like, aren’t you the guys from Footprints
   on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!

   Howard: I can’t watch.

   Raj: It’s okay. Oh, it’s okay. He’s done.

   Howard: Why is he looking at it?

   Raj: Eh, no, he’s not going to eat it, is he?

   Howard: Come on, Trent, you’re better than th-ah.

   Raj: Ooh!

   Howard: Let’s just go.

   Trent: Hey, aren’t you the guys?

   Howard: Nope.

   Raj: No, never heard of ’em!

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is listening to Darlin’

   Sheldon: I wonder why it was this particular song that was
   stuck in my head.

   Leonard: I don’t know. It’s pretty catchy.

   Penny: Do you even like the Beach Boys?

   Sheldon: They have beach right in the name. What do you think?

   Leonard: Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we
   get back to surface tension of domain walls?

   Sheldon: Of course. I’m already seeing a more efficient way of
   taming the ultravi… I know why the song was in my head.

   Penny: Why?

   Sheldon: It’s about Amy.

   Penny: Okay, look, I know Amy’s like an old lady, but she’s not
   old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.

   Sheldon: It’s about how she made my life better. Consider the
   lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn’t love, but
   now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften
   my life.”

   Penny: She did soften your life, didn’t she?

   Sheldon: Yes. She’s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have
   to go.

   Leonard: Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?

   Penny: Better. You’re the lint trap of my love.

   Leonard: Aw.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Amy: That’s an interesting tie clip.

   Dave: Oh, thanks. It’s, uh, Avogadro’s constant. It’s useful
   for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing
   regret in anyone who asks about it.

   Amy: No, I, I think it’s neat. Oh.

   Dave: Sorry. Sorry. No one’s ever liked the tie clip before, so
   I just lost all control.

   Amy: No, it, it’s okay, and we are on a date. I’m, I’m just a
   little nervous.

   Dave: Well, no need to be nervous with me. I’m just a harmless
   giant from a foreign land.

   Amy: You know, I’m just being silly. I, I don’t know what I’m
   waiting for.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?
   (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?

   Amy: That’s Sheldon.

   Dave: You’re kidding. How’s my hair?

   Amy: Sheldon, this, this isn’t a good time.

   Sheldon: I don’t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn’t get out
   of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and
   like that earworm, I can’t get you out of my heart. So, what
   I’m trying to say is, you’re my heartworm. The metaphorical
   kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.

   Amy: What?

   Dave: If I may, I believe what he’s saying, in a charming and
   delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave
   Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don’t mind me.

   Sheldon: I’m, I’m sorry; I didn’t realize you were on a date.

   Amy: No, it, it, it’s okay. Keep going?

   Sheldon: Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really
   want to be your boyfriend.

   Amy: I really want that, too.

   Sheldon: Good. Because I love you.

   Amy: I love you, too.

   Dave: Kiss her, you brilliant fool.

   Sheldon: Well, I’ll let you get back to your date.

   Amy: Get back here.

   Dave: Okay, then. I’ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for
   dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps
   sometime you have a spare moment, I’d, uh, love to discuss
   physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a
   lovely evening.

    This page takes a lot of time and effort to keep up to date.
   Perhaps if you get some use out of it, you could chuck me a few
                  pennies towards keeping it going.
