Series 1 Episode 14 – The Nerdvana Annihilation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I
   asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on
   wholewheat.

   Raj: What did they give you?

   Sheldon: Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on
   wholewheat. It’s the right ingredients but in the wrong order.
   In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to
   create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as
   well have dragged this thing through a car wash.

   Leonard: I don’t believe it.

   Sheldon: I know, it’s basic culinary science.

   Leonard: Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine
   prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it.

   Howard: A time machine from the movie The Time Machine?

   Leonard: No, a time machine from Sophie’s Choice.

   Raj: Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie.
   Did you see it, it’s rough.

   Howard: Oh, that’s cool.

   Leonard: Uh-huh.

   Raj: It’s only $800?

   Leonard: Yeah. And that’s my bid.

   Sheldon: You bid $800.

   Leonard: It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would
   go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it.

   Sheldon: There’s only 30 seconds left in the auction.

   Howard: Do you have $800?

   Leonard: Not to blow on a miniature time machine.

   Howard: Don’t worry, the way these things work there’s people
   waiting ‘til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and
   get it, it’s called sniping.

   Raj: Fifteen seconds.

   Leonard: Come on, snipers.

   Raj: Ten, nine, eight…

   Leonard: Where are your snipers?

   Raj: Five.

   Leonard: Snipe.

   Raj: Four.

   Leonard: Snipe.

   Raj: Three.

   Leonard: Snipe!

   Raj: Two.

   Leonard: SNIPE!

   Raj: One.

   Leonard: Aaaa-aw!

   Raj: Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature
   time machine.

   Howard: You lucky duck.

   Sheldon: I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece
   of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

   Leonard: Yeah, I know, I still can’t afford it.

   Howard: Why don’t we share it? We’ll each put in two hundred
   bucks and we’ll take turns having it in our homes.

   Raj: A time share time machine? I’m in. Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Need you ask? But I still don’t understand why no-one
   else bid.

   Scene: The lobby. The guys stand around a full sized time
   machine.

   Sheldon: I understand why no-one else bid.

   Credits sequence

   Scene: The same

   Raj: Did the listing actually say miniature?

   Leonard: I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine
   for $800?

   Sheldon: In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located
   within the intersection of the sets “no longer want my time
   machine” and “need $800”.

   Howard: It’s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping
   it works out to less than four dollars a pound.

   Raj: Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.

   Leonard: How are we going to get it upstairs?

   Howard: If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator.

   Leonard: Yes but the elevator’s been broken for two years.

   Sheldon: I’ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should
   make a call about that?

   Howard: Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I
   remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot
   space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to
   the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million
   miles away. (Presses lift button. Nothing happens.) No, that
   baby’s broken.

   Scene: The stairwell, approaching the apartment door. Leonard
   and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the last part of
   the stairs.

   Leonard: Come on, guys, push.

   Howard (off): If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to
   my colon.

   Raj (off): I can’t feel my fingers, hurry up.

   Sheldon: It’s the same amount of work no matter how fast you
   go, basic physics.

   Raj: Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Yeah.

   Raj: If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the
   middle one.

   Penny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, hey guys.

   Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon): Uh, hi
   Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine
   slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys!

   Penny: What are you doing?

   Leonard: Oh, just, you know, moving… something upstairs.

   Penny: What is it?

   Leonard: It’s… you know, time machine.

   Penny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….

   Leonard: Uh, just give us a few minutes.

   Penny: I don’t have a few minutes, I’m running really late.

   Sheldon: Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop
   over to the next building, there’s a small gap, don’t look down
   if you’re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.

   Penny: You’re joking, right?

   Sheldon: Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

   Penny: Damn, okay, I’ll just take the roof.

   Leonard: Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I
   can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it’s not…
   never mind.

   Sheldon: For what it’s worth, I thought it was humorous.

   Leonard: Let’s just do this. Guys, ready to push?

   Raj: In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up.

   Scene: The living room. The time machine is set up.

   Sheldon: I don’t know what you were worried about. I think it
   really works in the room.

   Leonard: Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever
   owned.

   Sheldon: The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor
   from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which
   society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean
   Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle
   surface dwelling Eloy.

   Howard: Talk about your chick magnets.

   Raj: Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I
   have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
   But wait until I tell him, I’ve got a time machine on my
   balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!

   Sheldon: Gentlemen, I know we said we’d take turns, but I think
   you’d agree that practicality dictates it remain here.

   Howard: You can’t just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and
   say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my
   friends house,” how lame is that?

   Raj: He’s got a point.

   Sheldon: Alright, I think we’re going to need some ground
   rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine
   and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants
   must be worn at all times in the time machine.

   Leonard: Seconded.

   Howard: I was going to put down a towel.

   Raj: I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a
   bi-monthly basis.

   Leonard: That sounds fair.

   Sheldon: Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean
   move it every other month, or twice a month?

   Raj: Twice a month.

   Sheldon: Then no.

   Raj: Okay, every other month.

   Sheldon: No.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you can’t be selfish, we all paid for it, so
   it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my
   time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the
   front illuminate. All let out an “oh”.) Okay, I am setting the
   dials for March 10^th, 1876.

   Howard: Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the
   telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.

   Sheldon: Wait a minute, I’d want to see that too.

   Leonard: So, when it’s your turn you can.

   Sheldon: But if we all go back to the same point in time,
   Bell’s lab is going to get very crowded, he’ll know something’s
   up.

   Raj: Also, since the time machine doesn’t move in space, you’ll
   end up in 1876 Pasadena.

   Howard: And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you
   going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs
   Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him
   invent the telephone?”

   Raj: Mrs Bell was deaf, she’s not even going to hear you knock.

   Sheldon: Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and
   obtain a cloaking device.

   Raj: Ooh, how far into the future?

   Sheldon: If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a
   cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which
   will be January 10^th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.

   Leonard: Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10^th, 2328.
   Here we go into the future. (Pulls lever, the disk begins to
   spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in
   fast motion.) That was fun.

   Raj: My turn.

   Penny (entering): Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was
   nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.

   Leonard: Are you okay?

   Penny: Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell
   of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire
   escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl
   through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I
   stay for lunch.

   Leonard: That doesn’t sound too bad.

   Penny: It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me
   up with their son.

   Leonard: Sorry.

   Penny: Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d
   given my shift away. Yeah, that’s right, I’ve lost an entire
   day’s pay thanks to this… this…

   Sheldon: Time machine.

   Leonard: The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?

   Penny: No! I don’t want to try it, my God, you are grown men,
   how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and
   costumes and comic books and… and now that… that…

   Sheldon: Again, time machine.

   Penny: Oh please, it’s not a time machine, if anything it looks
   like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.

   Sheldon: It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless
   in a swamp.

   Penny: Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. (Storms out.
   A beat, and then…)

   Raj: My turn!

   Scene: Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time
   machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.

   Sheldon: Leonard, it’s two in the morning.

   Leonard: So?

   Sheldon: So it’s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before
   yesterday?

   Leonard: Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting
   a time machine.

   Sheldon: You can’t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying
   it in the past, you would not have it available in the present
   to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would
   still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.

   Leonard: Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to
   me?

   Sheldon: Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and,
   say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the
   conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and
   knock me unconscious.

   Leonard: What if I knocked you unconscious right now?

   Sheldon: It won’t change the past.

   Leonard: But it would make the present so much nicer.

   Sheldon: Are you upset about something?

   Leonard: What was your first clue?

   Sheldon: Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour,
   then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your
   irritability…

   Leonard: Yes I’m upset.

   Sheldon: Oh! I don’t usually pick up on those things. Good for
   me.

   Leonard: Yeah, good for you.

   Sheldon: Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what’s bothering
   you?

   Leonard: I don’t know. Maybe.

   Sheldon: Wow, I’m on fire tonight.

   Leonard: Uh, here’s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up
   with guys who own time machines.

   Sheldon: I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny
   long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That
   failure clearly stands on its own.

   Leonard: Thanks for pointing it out.

   Sheldon: In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original
   film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time
   machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity
   to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.

   Leonard: Those are movies.

   Sheldon: Well of course they’re movies. Were you expecting me
   to come up with an example involving a real life time machine?
   That’s absurd.

   Scene: The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard
   and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.

   Leonard: Come on, guys, push.

   Howard (off): If I push any harder I’m going to give birth to
   my colon.

   Penny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, hey guys.

   Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon): Uh, hi
   Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine
   slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys!

   Penny: What are you doing?

   Leonard: Oh, just, you know, moving a… time machine.

   Penny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so….

   Leonard: No problem. (Removes glasses, pulls down out of order
   tape from lift doors, and forces them open.) Hang on. (Takes
   Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)

   Penny: But, what about your time machine.

   Leonard: Some things are more important than toys. (She puts
   her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)

   Penny: Oh, I’m scared.

   Leonard: Don’t worry baby, I’ve got you.

   Penny: Oh, Leonard. (Kisses him as they descend from view.
   Leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine.)

   Sheldon: It’s still my turn.

   Scene: The living room.

   Sheldon: What are you doing?

   Leonard: I’m packing up all my collectibles and taking them
   down to the comic book store to sell.

   Sheldon: Well is that really necessary. If you need money you
   can always sell blood. And semen.

   Leonard: It’s not about money.

   Raj (entering): We brought food.

   Howard: Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.

   Leonard: Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time
   machine?

   Raj: Why?

   Leonard: Because I don’t want it any more.

   Howard: Why?

   Leonard: Just… personal reasons.

   Sheldon: My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with
   Penny.

   Leonard: Look, do you want to buy me out or not?

   Raj: I’ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half
   owner, and we’ll put it on my balcony.

   Howard: Screw his balcony, I’ll give you a hundred and twenty
   and we’ll put it in my garage.

   Leonard: I paid two hundred dollars for my share.

   Raj: Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value
   the minute you drive it off the lot.

   Sheldon: I’ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right
   where it is.

   Raj: Three hundred, and I’ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel
   Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.

   Leonard: No, no more toys or action figures or props or
   replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers,
   I’m getting rid of all of it.

   Howard: You can’t do that, look what you’ve created here, it’s
   like nerdvana.

   Raj: More importantly, you’ve a Darth Vader voice changer?

   Leonard: Not for long.

   Raj: Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.

   Howard: Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of
   America collection.

   Raj: Too bad, I called dibs.

   Howard: Well you can’t just call dibs.

   Raj: I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.

   Sheldon: Dibs doesn’t apply in a bidding war.

   Leonard: It’s not a bidding war, I’m selling it all to Larry
   down at the comic book store.

   Raj: Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?

   Howard: Will you forget dibs!

   Leonard: He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.

   Sheldon: What’s the number, I’ll match it.

   Raj: I’ll match it, plus a thousand rupees.

   Sheldon: What’s the exchange rate.

   Raj: None of your business. Take it or leave it.

   Howard (on phone): Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got?
   Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in
   Israel.

   Leonard: Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two
   are going to be really mad at me.

   Sheldon: Who cares, as long as you pick me.

   Raj: Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let’s talk.

   Leonard: Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.

   Sheldon (moving to block his path): No. I can’t let you do
   this.

   Leonard: Sheldon, get out of my way.

   Sheldon (brandishing toy sword from Leonard’s box): None shall
   pass.

   Leonard: Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the
   rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next
   Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original
   packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.

   Howard: Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here.

   Penny (coming out of her flat): What the hell’s going on?

   Sheldon: You hypocrite!

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I
   were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie
   Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little
   Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on
   your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!

   Penny: Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I
   am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.

   Leonard: No, I needed to hear it.

   Penny: No you didn’t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is
   things you love that make you who you are.

   Howard: I guess that makes me large breasts.

   Leonard: Still, I think it’s time for me to get rid of this
   stuff and… you know… move on with my life.

   Penny: Really?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: Oh. Wow. Good for you. (Kisses his cheek.)

   Leonard: Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don’t know, later…

   Good looking man coming up stairs: Excuse me. Hey, Penny!

   Penny: Hi Mike.

   Mike: Are you ready to go.

   Penny: Yeah, I just have to change.

   Mike: I’ll give you a hand.

   Penny: Oh, stop it! Bye guys.

   Leonard (after a long pause): My turn on the time machine.

   Scene: A jungle. As the camera moves, the time machine becomes
   visible. Sheldon is sitting in it The disk stops spinning, and
   he looks around. The dials read APR 28 802,701.

   Sheldon: It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but
   it worked. (Large hairy creatures with glowing eyes emerge from
   the forest and walk towards him menacingly.) Oh no, not
   Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! (With
   a yelp, he wakes up in the time machine in the living room.)

   Leonard: Sheldon, are you okay?

   Sheldon: We have to get rid of the time machine.

   Leonard: It is a little big for the living room, isn’t it?

   Sheldon: Yeah, that’s the problem, it’s too big.

   Leonard: I’m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move
   it, come on in fellas. (A pair of Morlocks come through the
   door.)

   Sheldon: Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. (Sheldon
   wakes up in his own bed.) Leonard!!!!!!!!
