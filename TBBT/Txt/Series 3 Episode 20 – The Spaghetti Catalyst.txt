Series 3 Episode 20 – The Spaghetti Catalyst

   Scene: The lobby.

   Penny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new
   MasterCard!

   Sheldon: Uh-oh.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: I was going to get my mail.

   Penny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?

   Sheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just
   wasn’t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are
   no longer having coitus.

   Penny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?

   Sheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the
   same building, you see each other all the time. The variable
   which has changed is the coitus.

   Penny: Okay, here’s the protocol, you and I are still friends,
   and you stop saying coitus.

   Sheldon: Good, good. I’m glad we’re still friends.

   Penny: Really?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my
   life. I’d hate for that effort to have been in vain.

   Penny: Right.

   Sheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with
   everyone or just you?

   Penny: Everyone.

   Sheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I’ll just substitute
   intercourse.

   Penny: Great.

   Sheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental
   overtones, so I’ll hold that in reserve.

   Penny: So, how you been?

   Sheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I’ve been what I
   am at each point in the implied time period.

   Penny: You’re just coitusing with me, aren’t you?

   Sheldon: Bazinga.

   Penny: Mmm. How’s Leonard doing?

   Sheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a
   disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and
   smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of
   it, he asked me not to tell you that.

   Penny: I’ll pretend I didn’t hear it.

   Sheldon: I’d rather you pretend I didn’t say it. I see you
   bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.

   Penny: Yep.

   Sheldon: That’s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking
   Italian because according to her, that’s what the Romans made
   Jesus eat.

   Penny: Interesting. I’ll have to have you over for spaghetti
   some night.

   Sheldon: I’m hungry now.

   Penny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don’t you give me an hour and come
   over?

   Sheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix
   them in with the sauce?

   Penny: I don’t have hot dogs.

   Sheldon: Oh, it’s all right, I do. Oh! You’re in for what my
   mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).

   Leonard: Hey, where you been?

   Sheldon: I was talking with Penny.

   Howard: What’s wrong with you? You can’t hang out with your
   roommate’s ex. That’s totally uncool.

   Leonard: No, no, it’s fine. I don’t care. I’m over it.

   Raj: Yeah, he’s over it, that’s why he’s been whining all day
   about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in
   Black.

   Sheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I’d like to erase
   Ben Affleck as Daredevil.

   Howard: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like
   this you got to pick sides. You’re either on Team Leonard or
   Team Penny.

   Sheldon: Which one picks last?

   Howard: What?

   Sheldon: Well, usually I’m on the team that picks last. Unless
   there’s a kid in a wheelchair.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope
   you’re hungry.

   Sheldon: Well, of course I’m hungry. And as I have no plans to
   eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken
   with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!

   Leonard: Okay.

   Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?

   Leonard: I don’t know. Why?

   Sheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!

   Scene: A few moments later.

   Howard: Oh, God, this is good.

   Raj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you’re going to
   go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?

   Howard: Jews don’t have hell. We have acid reflux.

   Leonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Certainly. It’s not like I have to moderate my food
   intake because I’m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm,
   mm, mm!

   Leonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?

   Howard: Nah, I can’t. I got to pick up my mom from her water
   aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a
   swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.

   Leonard: What about you, Raj?

   Raj: Oh, there it is, now that you don’t have a girlfriend, you
   want to hang out with me again.

   Leonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.

   Raj: Oh, please, we all know I’m the friend you call when you
   have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I’d be
   Aquaman.

   Howard: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop
   my mom out of the old lady tank.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, I’m thirsty, so I’m going to go to the
   refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.

   Leonard: You know what? I’ll just spend the evening alone.

   Raj: What, suddenly I’m not good enough for you?

   Sheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I’ll take my
   after-dinner walk.

   Leonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?

   Howard: Yeah, since when do you take walks?

   Sheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not
   only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know
   me, if there’s one thing I like more than a refreshing
   beverage, it’s serotonin. Bye-bye.

   Howard: Hold on. I’ll walk down with you.

   Sheldon: Oh, that’s not necessary. You can go first.

   Howard: Or we could go together.

   Sheldon: I can’t think of a reason why not.

   Howard: Let’s go.

   Sheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.

   Raj: I’ve missed you.

   Scene: The lobby.

   Sheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.

   Howard: Okay.

   Sheldon: What?

   Howard: You said you were going for a walk.

   Sheldon: I didn’t say outside.

   Howard: So what, you’re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?

   Sheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious
   behavior.

   Woman’s voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.

   Howard: Which way are you going?

   Sheldon: Which way are you going?

   Howard: I parked my scooter down the block.

   Sheldon: I’m going the other way. Bye.

   Howard: Bye. Actually, I’m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?

   Sheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.

   Howard: I definitely smell raw hot dog.

   Sheldon: Perhaps you’re getting a brain tumour.

   Howard: All right, have a nice walk.

   Sheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.

   Howard: You might want to stand back. I’m sitting on top of 13
   horses here.

   Sheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you
   smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock)
   Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens
   door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I
   had to trade the others for my life.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Hey, Leonard?

   Leonard: Yeah?

   Raj: I haven’t had sex in a year.

   Leonard: Where you going with this, Raj?

   Raj: Don’t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a
   woman.

   Leonard: So, go.

   Raj: Well, I need a wingman. I don’t want to come off like a
   lonely loser.

   Leonard: And you think my presence will help with that?

   Raj: Well, I do. Next to you, I’ll look like a catch.

   Leonard: I’m not going out tonight, Raj.

   Raj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and
   downloaded some Asian pornography?

   Leonard: Very much.

   Raj: Doesn’t have to be Asian.

   Leonard: Don’t worry. You’ll meet a girl someday.

   Raj: No, I won’t.

   Leonard: Yes, you will, and she’ll be beautiful, and kind and
   sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.

   Raj: You really think so?

   Leonard: I do, and you’ll fall hopelessly in love and give her
   your heart. And she’ll take it and grind it into pathetic,
   little pieces.

   Raj: But we’ll have sex first, right?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Sheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That’s Eye-talian.

   Penny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I’m fine, I don’t care. And
   he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to
   believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and
   betrayal.

   Penny: Well, good.

   Sheldon: I’m also pleased to report that he’s all cried out
   over you.

   Penny: He’s been crying?

   Sheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn’t
   supposed to mention.

   Penny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.

   Sheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?

   Penny: No. Why, do you?

   Sheldon: No.

   Penny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?

   Sheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.

   Penny: All right. So, what’s new in your life?

   Sheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.

   Penny: Have you been running?

   Sheldon: No. It’s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

   Penny: I’m so glad you like it.

   Sheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.

   Penny: Well, maybe that’s ’cause Leonard can’t cook.

   Sheldon: You can’t cook and you made me this.

   Penny: Whatever. Ooh, I’m gonna get the cheesecake out of the
   fridge.

   Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I’m in Jewish hell.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Look at this. Do you think she’s really doing that or is
   it PhotoShop?

   Leonard: I’m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a
   room full of big, fat Japanese guys.

   Raj: You don’t know that. Prison changes people.

   Leonard: Hey, where you been?

   Sheldon: I told you, walking.

   Leonard: For an hour and a half?

   Sheldon: I got lost.

   Leonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.

   Sheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.

   Raj: There are no solar flares right now.

   Sheldon: Yes, there are.

   Raj: Dude, I’m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares,
   I’d be all up in it.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my
   battery died.

   Leonard: What the hell was that about?

   Raj: I don’t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton
   doing it with Oprah?

   Leonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.

   Scene: Leonard’s bedroom. Leonard is asleep.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock)
   Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.

   Leonard: Oh, just come in!

   Sheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

   Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Maybe this isn’t a good time.

   Leonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will
   kill you.

   Sheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate
   way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social
   skills astonishes me.

   Leonard: What do you want?

   Sheldon: You may want to sit down.

   Leonard: I’m in bed!

   Sheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.

   Leonard: Sheldon!

   Sheldon: I’ve been seeing Penny behind your back.

   Leonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does
   that mean?

   Sheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with
   little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up
   the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell
   hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back
   to it?

   Leonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?

   Sheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I
   like spaghetti with little hot dogs.

   Leonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?

   Sheldon: I didn’t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear
   that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who
   sell their bodies for money.

   Leonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?

   Sheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I don’t care if you want to be friends with
   Penny.

   Sheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that’s been keeping
   me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we
   butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.

   Leonard: I guess not.

   Sheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the
   Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.

   Scene: The laundry room.

   Penny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.

   Leonard: D-don’t be silly. We’re neighbours, we’re going to run
   into each other, may as well get used to it.

   Penny: Yeah, I guess you’re right.

   Leonard: You used to it yet?

   Penny: Nope.

   Leonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be
   upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to
   know it’s fine.

   Penny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.

   Leonard: His mother?

   Penny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and
   towels.

   Leonard: I was going to do that.

   Penny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.

   Leonard: No, I don’t want to do it. You can do it.

   Penny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.

   Leonard: I just took him for shoes.

   Penny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.

   Leonard: Fine. I’ll take him for shoes next Saturday.

   Penny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to
   Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.

   Leonard: You’re taking him to Disneyland?

   Penny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going
   to say no?

   Leonard: All right. But let me know if you’re going to stuff
   him with junk food. I don’t want to bring home a nice dinner
   for him and see it go to waste.

   Penny: We’re going to Disneyland. He’s going to eat junk food.

   Leonard: All I’m saying is give me a heads-up.

   Penny: Okay, whatever.

   Leonard: And don’t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats.
   He’ll say he can handle it, but I promise you’ll end up with
   churro puke on your shoes.

   Penny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?

   Leonard: Yeah, don’t let Goofy near him. He’ll have nightmares
   and I’ll have to deal with it.

   Penny: What’s the problem with Goofy?

   Leonard: Wish I knew. He’s fine with Pluto.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles
   needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?

   Howard: Well, that’s it. We’re officially out of things to talk
   about.

   Penny: We’re home.

   Leonard: It’s ten o’clock, where have you been?

   Sheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It
   was pure Disney magic.

   Leonard: I was going to see that with him.

   Penny: How was I supposed to know that?

   Sheldon: It’s all right. I’ll see it again with you.

   Leonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.

   Penny: I know, I know.

   Sheldon: I can still eat.

   Penny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and
   brush your teeth.

   Sheldon: Okay, but just don’t fight

   Leonard: We’re not fighting.

   Penny: Just go.

   Leonard: Aren’t you going to thank Penny for taking you to
   Disneyland?

   Sheldon: Thank you, Penny.

   Penny: You’re welcome, sweetie.

   Leonard: Want a cup of coffee?

   Penny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.

   Leonard: Come on. It’s just a cup of coffee.

   Penny: Yep, okay.

   Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole
   thing seems a little twisted to me, too.

   Leonard: What am I smelling?

   Penny: Sheldon’s churro on my shoes.

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Penny: He’s such an angel when he’s asleep.

   Leonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.

   Penny: I think we can do it.

   Leonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn’t that be wrong?

   Penny: No, be friends. You and me.

   Leonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.

   Penny: Good. I’m glad.

   Leonard: Here’s an idea. I’m just throwing it out there,
   friends who have sex.

   Penny: Good night, Leonard.

   Leonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin’ around.

   Sheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no.
