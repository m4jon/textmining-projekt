Series 6 Episode 10 – The Fish Guts Displacement

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?

   Leonard: Why would it trouble you? It’s, like, your third
   favourite cartoon theme song.

   Sheldon: It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget.,
   and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.

   Howard and Raj (together): Turtle power!

   Sheldon: However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man,
   Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.

   Howard: Yeah, so?

   Sheldon: I can think of many things Spider-Man can’t do that a
   spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave
   Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.

   Raj: an we change the subject? Spiders give me the
   jeebie-jeebies.

   Howard: It’s heebie-jeebies.

   Raj: I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was
   thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The
   theme, movies that killed their franchises.

   Leonard: Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.

   Raj: Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know
   a movie’s bad when my homegirl Sandy B can’t save it.

   Leonard: Penny’s working tonight, I’m in.

   Howard: Not me. I’m having dinner with Bernadette and her
   parents.

   Leonard: Fun. We know how much you love that.

   Howard: It’s torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing
   in common.

   Sheldon: You know what I like to do when I’m forced to speak
   with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an
   interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and
   spiders.

   Howard: Thanks, Sheldon. I’ll try that with my father-in-law.

   Sheldon: No, you can’t use that one. That’s mine. Uh, try this
   one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no
   place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from
   which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and
   come up in China.

   Howard: Great, thank you.

   Sheldon: Actually, you can’t have that one either. It’s too
   good. Sorry.

   Raj: What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?

   Sheldon: Sadly, yes. Amy’s taking me to a memorial service.
   It’s for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my
   planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no
   matter how deep they dig his grave, he’ll never make his way
   back to China.

   Leonard: That should lighten the mood.

   Sheldon: What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.
   Oh, right, funeral. (Knock, knock, knock) (solemnly) Amy.

   Amy: Hello, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: I’m not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but
   you can wear a bathrobe?

   Amy: I think I’m too sick to go to the funeral.

   Sheldon: You’re sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.

   Amy: Sheldon, aren’t you gonna take care of me?

   Sheldon: Me? No. No, I’m not that kind of doctor.

   Amy: But our relationship agreement clearly states that when
   one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind
   that clause was to force you to take care of me when I’m ill.
   When you’re feeling better, you’ll think that’s funny.

   Amy: Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.
   (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. I made a commitment in writing to
   comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my
   girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.

   Amy: Thank you, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. Now let’s get this over with.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: So, how have you been?

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine.

   Howard: Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?

   Mr. Rostenkowski: It’s fine.

   Howard: I’m sensing a theme. You ever really think about the
   Spider-Man theme song? How’s that dinner coming?

   Bernadette: I just put it in. It’s gonna be a while.

   Howard: I like rare chicken. Let’s do this.

   Bernadette: You could die.

   Howard: Death by chicken. That’s a pretty fowl way to go.

   Mrs. Rostenkowski: Here’s another beer, honey.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Thank you.

   Howard: So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand
   Canyon. How was it?

   Mrs. Rostenkowski: It was good.

   Howard: Had no idea you were the chatty one.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Sheldon: 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It’s like
   you’re not even trying to get better.

   Amy: Sheldon, you don’t get over the flu in half an hour.

   Sheldon: Well, not with that attitude.

   Amy: I have to say, I’m finding your bedside manner a little
   lacking.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as
   possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a
   question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?

   Amy: Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its
   validity.

   Sheldon: Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is
   really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your
   illness as well as freshen your breath.

   Amy: Sheldon, this isn’t helping. Why don’t you just let me get
   some rest.

   Sheldon: How can you sleep? I’m not done making you feel
   better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to
   you and apply VapoRub to your chest.

   Amy: You, you want to rub something on my chest?

   Sheldon: Yes. All over it.

   Amy: Maybe we should start with that.

   Sheldon: Now you’re being a responsible patient. Now, you may
   notice some tingling.

   Amy: Oh, I’m counting on it.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s apartment.

   Howard: Okay, dig in.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts
   which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ
   our Lord. Amen.

   Howard: Took the words right out of my mouth.

   Bernadette: So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?

   Mr. Rostenkowski: I’m going next weekend.

   Howard: Oh, you like to fish?

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Yes.

   Howard: Sure. I can hear it in your voice.

   Mrs. Rostenkowski: Oh, if he didn’t like it, he wouldn’t go.

   Howard: You know, I hadn’t thought of that. (To Bernadette,
   whispering) Help me.

   Bernadette: Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing
   sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other
   better.

   Howard: No, no. We know each other well enough. He’s been
   talking my ear off all night.

   Bernadette: Howie, I think you’d have fun.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Fine, you can tag along.

   Bernadette: Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin’.

   Howard: Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have
   that thing.

   Bernadette: What thing?

   Howard: You know, the thing.

   Bernadette: Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, it’s settled. You and I are going
   fishing.

   Howard: Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Howard: I’ve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a
   disaster.

   Raj: If you don’t want to look foolish doing something, you
   should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made
   by myself before I invited you guys over? I’ll give you a hint.
   You can see them here, here and here.

   Leonard: Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give
   you some pointers.

   Howard: Do either of you guys know how to fish?

   Leonard: No.

   Raj: No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in
   banana leaves.

   Howard: Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff
   like this.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: S’up?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Step one, worms.

   Howard: Ew!

   Penny: Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you’re not
   gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It’s right up
   there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.

   Howard: Really?

   Penny: You’re gonna have to do it when you’re fishing.

   Howard: Okay.

   Penny: What are you waiting for?

   Howard: I don’t know, for them to die of natural causes.

   Penny: Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.

   Howard: Fine. There.

   Leonard: I’m no expert, but I think the hook has to go through
   the worm.

   Howard: Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.

   Penny: Hey, don’t name him. Just jab a hook in his face.

   Raj: You got this, buddy.

   Leonard: Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.

   Raj: You can do it.

   Penny: That’s great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Sheldon (reading): And the control group displayed
   significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of
   flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and
   diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.

   Amy: That was great. Rub my chest again. (Knock at door)

   Sheldon: No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some
   reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. (Opens door)

   Bernadette: How’s the poor thing?

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m hanging in there. Thanks for asking.

   Bernadette: Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working
   on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but
   there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid,
   so if you take it, happy thoughts.

   Sheldon: Uh, I’m going to draw you a soothing bath. Where’s
   your bath thermometer?

   Amy: I don’t have a bath thermometer.

   Sheldon: Fine. Then I’m going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath
   of indeterminate temperature.

   Bernadette: This is a really good expectorant. Although some
   test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard
   music.

   Amy: Okay, okay, here’s the deal. I don’t need your medicine.
   I’m not sick.

   Bernadette: I don’t understand.

   Amy: I got better two days ago. It’s just been so nice having
   Sheldon take care of me.

   Bernadette: So you’ve just been lying to him?

   Amy: See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.

   Bernadette: I don’t mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of
   thing lunatics do.

   Amy: All right. I’ll tell him.

   Sheldon (off): Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe
   yourself, or do you need my help?

   Amy: I’ll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: Now, let’s assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a
   fish. You’re going to have to know how to gut it. So, what
   you’re going to do is you’re going to take your knife, slice
   him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?

   Howard: No, I’m fine. Keep going.

   Penny: All right. Now, you don’t want to cut too deep into its
   guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.
   (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you
   guys?

   Leonard: It’s not our fault. Our dads never did anything like
   this with us.

   Penny: What, never?

   Leonard: My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time
   he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy.
   I hated that kid.

   Raj: Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so
   bored, I’d put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and
   pretend I was ice-skating.

   Howard: Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my
   adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come
   back someday.

   Raj: Yeah, okay, Howard wins.

   Leonard: You know, maybe we didn’t have opportunities like this
   when we were growing up, but right now, there’s a dad that
   wants to take you on a fishing trip.

   Howard: You’re right. Oh! I should do this.

   Penny: Great. Here you go. What you’re going to do is you’re
   going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and
   pull.

   Howard: Here we go. Oh!

   Penny: Oh, look, it’s a female. You can see all the eggs. (All
   the guys gag)

   Scene: Amy’s apartment. Amy is dancing to “Walking on
   Sunshine”. Hears door and turns off stereo.

   Amy: Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you’re back. Taking a turn for the
   worst. I think I’m going to need another bath.

   Sheldon: I’m surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was
   concerned that you weren’t recovering, so while you were
   sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.

   Amy: Oh?

   Sheldon: I got the results back. Have you developed any of the
   following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation
   in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar,
   pants on fire.

   Amy: All right, all right. But I really was sick at the
   beginning. It’s just been so nice having you take care of me.

   Sheldon: It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our
   relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that
   skews in my favour.

   Amy: I feel terrible I did this.

   Sheldon: It pains me to say it, but I think some form of
   penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour
   in the future.

   Amy: I suppose that’s fair. What do you suggest?

   Sheldon: In a perfect world, I’d lock you in a stockade in the
   public square. That probably requires a permit.

   Amy: I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next
   Star Trek movie.

   Sheldon: Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a
   human weakness, you didn’t kill a man. You know, it’s a tad
   old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my
   brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving
   whiskey.

   Amy: Are you saying you want to spank me?

   Sheldon: I don’t want to. But it looks like you left me no
   choice.

   Amy: That’s true. I’ve been a very bad girl.

   Scene: Bernadette’s parents’ garage.

   Howard: Hi-ho, hi-ho, it’s off to fish we go.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s what you’re wearing?

   Howard: No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these
   are what fishermen wear.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Maybe in cartoons.

   Howard: Wish I had known that before I posted all those
   pictures on Facebook.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: All right, let’s hit the road. I wouldn’t
   mind shooting some ducks in the morning.

   Howard: Wait, now we’re shooting things?

   Mr. Rostenkowski: I like using a big shell. You can’t eat them
   afterwards, but it’s fun watching them blow up.

   Howard: Sir, I’m flattered that you invited me, and I really
   want you to like me, but I don’t think this trip is the way to
   do it. And I can’t return these things if there’s chunks of
   duck all over them.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: So, why’d you agree to come?

   Howard: ‘Cause Bernadette made me.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had
   to go.

   Howard: Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You’re a big,
   scary cop.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: You’re an astronaut, and your wife makes you
   do things, and she’s only four feet tall.

   Howard: So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for
   the weekend.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Ah. There’s an Indian casino near Palm
   Springs. You know how to shoot craps?

   Howard: No, but I’m not a stranger to dice games. I was the
   Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Mazel tov. I’ll teach you how to play.

   Howard: Really? Thank you, sir.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: Call me Mike.

   Howard: Okay. Oh, boy, we’re just married to a couple of
   ballbusters, huh, Mike?

   Mr. Rostenkowski: That’s my wife and daughter you’re talking
   about.

   Howard: Great couple of gals.

   Mr. Rostenkowski: I wouldn’t go that far.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Sheldon: Are you prepared to receive your punishment?

   Amy: One second. I want to put on some music.

   Sheldon: Why?

   Amy: I don’t want to disturb the people next door while you
   discipline me.

   Sheldon: Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let’s begin.

   Amy: Oh, my.

   Sheldon: Excuse me. You’re not supposed to be enjoying this.

   Amy: Then maybe you should spank me harder.

   Sheldon: Maybe I will.

   Amy: Ooh!
