Series 6 Episode 16 – The Tangible Affection Proof

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: You’ll never believe what happened to me at work today.

   Leonard: Hmm?

   Penny: This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his
   life.

   Leonard: You’re kidding. Did you Heimlich him?

   Penny: No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy’s choking,
   and then one of the busboys Heimlich’ed him.

   Leonard: You’re a hero.

   Penny: Yeah, that was the point of the story.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have
   Thursday night off?

   Penny: Um, I think so. Why?

   Leonard: What do you mean, why? It’s Valentine’s Day.

   Penny: Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.

   Leonard: You could be a little more into it.

   Penny: No, I’m into it, I’m into it. Just, there’s so much
   pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.

   Leonard: Okay, well, this time it’s going to be different.
   Because I am like a romance ninja. You don’t see it coming, and
   then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!

   Penny: You know, sometimes I think I’ve made you so much cooler
   than you used to be, and then you go and do that.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation
   felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the
   rectum does possess the sense of taste.

   Amy: I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing
   for Valentine’s Day?

   Sheldon: Oh, you caught that, did you?

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Howard (on phone): Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.

   Raj: Everything okay?

   Howard: Bernie’s a little cranky since she’s been working,
   like, 17 hours a day. And I’ve got a lot on my plate, too,
   because I’ve been busting my tail playing Assassin’s Creed.

   Raj: Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine’s
   Day?

   Stuart: Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects
   around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you
   got going on?

   Raj: Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special
   little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her
   to the vet.

   Stuart: There must be something we can do.

   Raj: Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we
   throw a party for all the people who don’t have dates?

   Stuart That actually sounds kind of nice.

   Raj: Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can
   have is the love he has with himself.

   Stuart: That’s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in
   the pants.

   Scene: Sheldon’s office.

   Sheldon: Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I
   believe you can help with.

   Alex: Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I’ve been waiting for an
   opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.

   Sheldon: Oh, no, no. That’s not going to happen, no. What I
   need you to do is find a Valentine’s gift for my girlfriend.

   Alex: You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at
   Fermilab to take this job with you.

   Sheldon: Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone
   else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let’s see,
   this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she
   likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah,
   kids say the darnedest things.

   Scene: Howard’s lab.

   Leonard: Hey, you coming to lunch?

   Howard: Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you
   something.

   Leonard: What you looking at?

   Howard: Well, I was trying to come up with something really
   romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine’s Day since she’s
   been such a pain in the ass.

   Leonard: You can’t find a card that says that?

   Howard: Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the
   material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one
   one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.

   Leonard: Oh, that’s cool.

   Howard: A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.

   Leonard: From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did
   this take you?

   Howard: Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.

   Leonard: Oh, wow.

   Howard: Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video
   game time. What are you and Penny doing?

   Leonard: Oh, I’m going to take her to a nice restaurant for
   dinner.

   Howard: Oh, that’s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think
   my gift hits it right out of… (Bumps into chair and drops the
   slide)

   Leonard: Want to come to dinner with us?

   Howard: Yes, please.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect
   Valentine’s gift, so, you’re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.

   Alex: Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on
   Amy’s Facebook page and read up on her interests.

   Sheldon: Now, see, I never would have thought to do that.
   Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am
   telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks
   are on. Let’s knock them off.

   Alex: Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found
   this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.

   Sheldon: Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any
   song. What are you trying to pull here?

   Alex: No, I just thought it would be…

   Sheldon: Next.

   Alex: Okay. Um, I know she’s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.

   Sheldon: Mmm.

   Alex: So I found this cool map that illustrates the character’s
   journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really
   nice frame.

   Sheldon: But she’s got Google Maps on her phone.

   Alex: I don’t know how to respond to that.

   Sheldon: Well, I hope it’s with a third good option, because
   these first two, buh.

   Alex: Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since
   Amy’s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that
   Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did
   lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find
   this signed print.

   Sheldon: Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.

   Alex: Thank you.

   Sheldon: I think I’ll keep it for myself.

   Alex: What about your girlfriend?

   Sheldon: It’s too late. I call dibs.

   Scene: a restaurant.

   Penny: This place is really beautiful.

   Leonard: Waugh, romance ninja.

   Penny: Hey.

   Howard: Sorry we’re late.

   Penny: No problem. We just sat down.

   Leonard: Mmm, would you like some wine?

   Bernadette: Yeah, fill her up. I’ll tell you when to stop.

   Penny: Is everything okay?

   Howard: Terrific. Couldn’t be better.

   Bernadette: Oh, bite me.

   Howard: Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me
   where it is.

   Bernadette: Maybe if you did what you said you were going to
   do, I’d tell you.

   Leonard: Uh, where what is?

   Howard: She hid my Xbox like I’m a child. Yeah, and my mom got
   me that for my birthday, so if you don’t give it back, I’m
   telling.

   Bernadette: I’ve been working late every night. All I asked was
   that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did
   he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You
   like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing
   machine.

   Howard: I said I’m sorry.

   Bernadette: Sorry doesn’t clean my underpants, buddy.

   Howard: I told you, turn them inside out.

   Bernadette: And I told you to bite me.

   Leonard: Trying to have a magical night here, guys.

   Penny: Oh, son of a bitch.

   Leonard: What?

   Penny: Nothing. Nothing.

   Leonard: No, tell me.

   Penny: It’s just this guy I used to date.

   Leonard: Oh.

   Penny: Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who’s
   here with him now.

   Leonard: You’re kidding.

   Penny: And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.

   Leonard: I know it’s not ideal, but don’t let them ruin our
   night.

   Penny: No, you’re totally right. She could be skinny ’cause
   she’s dying.

   Leonard: That’s the spirit.

   Penny: You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way
   more special than theirs.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Bernadette: Uh-oh.

   Penny: What? (Penny’s ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you got
   to be kidding me.

   Gretchen: Oh, my God, yes. Of course I’ll marry you.

   Leonard: Two can play this game. Penny…

   Penny: Get up.

   Leonard: All right.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Raj: It’s nice that all the people who are lonely on
   Valentine’s Day can come here tonight and be together.

   Stuart: Yeah, I’m really looking forward to it. In fact,
   there’s no place I would rather be than here.

   Raj: Except on a date with anybody.

   Stuart: Literally anybody.

   Raj: You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you
   were a girl, all our problems would be solved.

   Stuart: What?

   Raj: Oh, yeah, think about it. We’d hang out, we’d read comic
   books, we’d see movies. It’d be like the best relationship
   ever.

   Stuart: That does sound nice.

   Raj: Then I’d take you home, slip off your little black dress
   and just pile-drive you into oblivion.

   Stuart: What?

   Scene: The restaurant.

   Penny: Oh, I can’t believe he’s going to marry the girl he
   cheated on me with.

   Leonard: Isn’t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong
   person, and now he found the right person.

   Penny: What, so I’m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with
   Gretchen, too.

   Bernadette: They do look happy.

   Howard: Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he’ll be
   crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.

   Leonard: You know what? Why don’t we just forget about them and
   enjoy our Valentine’s Day?

   Penny: Yes, absolutely. Now they’re doing that phony
   link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.

   Leonard: I thought we were letting it go.

   Penny: We were; it’s just, it’s not fair, okay? They’re bad
   people. It’s not supposed to end happy for them, it’s supposed
   to end happy for me.

   Leonard: Um, it did end happy for you. You’re here with me.

   Penny: Yeah, yeah, I know.

   Leonard: Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take
   personally.

   Penny: Oh, come on, don’t make this about you.

   Leonard: Oh, I’m not. It’s about you.

   Penny: Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine’s Day
   sucks.

   Leonard: This one does, and you’re the reason why.

   Penny: What?

   Bernadette: You know, compared to them, I’m feeling pretty good
   about us.

   Howard: Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early,
   I’ll do that laundry.

   Bernadette: Thank you.

   Howard: I love you.

   Bernadette: Love you, too.

   Howard: So where’d you hide it?

   Bernadette: Where you’d never look.

   Howard: Damn it, it’s in the washing machine.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy: Hello.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Amy: Happy Valentine’s Day.

   Sheldon: Okay. Shall we go to dinner?

   Amy: Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening
   of romance and gifts.

   Sheldon: Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy
   it. I’ve been working on this facial expression all day.

   Amy: And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I
   decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner
   reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate
   Valentine’s Day.

   Sheldon: What is that?

   Amy: By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We
   stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War
   Trek things.

   Sheldon: Really?

   Amy: Well, that’s what you’d love, isn’t it?

   Sheldon: More than anything.

   Amy: Well, then, that’s what we’re going to do.

   Sheldon: Well, I don’t know what to say. This is the most
   thoughtful gift that anyone’s ever given me. And that’s
   including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.

   Amy: I’m your girlfriend. That’s my job. And I know gift-giving
   puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can
   return.

   Sheldon: No. No, after everything you didn’t do for me tonight,
   I want you to have it.

   Amy: What’s this?

   Sheldon: Read it.

   Amy: Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?

   Sheldon: At the bottom.

   Amy: In case of emergency, please contact… Amy Farrah Fowler.
   And there’s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift
   you could’ve ever given me.

   Sheldon: Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone,
   who would I want to share that with?

   Amy: And you picked me.

   Sheldon: It’s like you said, you’re my girlfriend.

   Amy: Oh, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine’s Day and order my
   pizza.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Penny: Night.

   Leonard: Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I
   mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it’s
   like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.

   Penny: Yeah, I know. I’m a total bitch.

   Leonard: I’m not saying that.

   Penny: Well, I am.

   Leonard: Fine, you win. You’re a bitch. Why couldn’t we just
   have a nice time?

   Penny: I don’t know. Maybe ’cause things are going so well
   between us lately and I’ve been really happy.

   Leonard: Okay, you’re gonna have to make a lot more sense than
   that.

   Penny: Obviously, I have some commitment issues.

   Leonard: Glaringly obvious. Go on.

   Penny: As long as things keep going great between us, you’ll
   keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I’m gonna end up
   saying yes, and then we’re gonna be married forever, and the
   whole thing just freaks me out.

   Leonard: Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I
   promise I will never ask you to marry me again.

   Penny: What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?

   Leonard: No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want
   to get married, you have to propose to me.

   Penny: Really?

   Leonard: Yes. It’s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the
   time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one
   knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.

   Penny: Yeah, you got it.

   Leonard: And I’m cool with surprises. But nothing on a
   Jumbotron. I don’t want to cry on a big screen like that.

   Penny: Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but
   I have a very important question to ask you.

   Leonard: You do?

   Penny: Leonard Hofstadter?

   Leonard: Yes?

   Penny: Will you be my valentine?

   Leonard: Sorry. Maybe next year. I’m just kidding. Romance
   ninja. Let’s have sex. Waugh!

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Nerdy guy: Thank you, guys, for doing this.

   Raj: We’re glad you could make it.

   Nerdy guy: Usually I spend Valentine’s Day sad and alone. This
   year, I’m just sad.

   Raj: What is it about this holiday that makes people so
   unhappy?

   Stuart: I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight’s
   the night I know everyone else does, too.

   Nerdy guy: I think you’re cool.

   Stuart: Great.

   Raj: I got to tell you, we’ve got to stop beating ourselves up
   like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention,
   please? We’re all here tonight because we have no one to be
   with. But that doesn’t make us mutants. The only mutants here
   are in these comic books. We’ve got to stop defining our
   self-worth by whether or not we’re in a relationship. You know
   what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great
   people. So let’s give ourselves a break. We are a community,
   and as long as we have each other, we’re never truly alone.

   Girl: That was cool. What you said.

   Raj: You really think so?

   Girl: Yeah, I do.

   Raj: Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of
   coffee or…?

   Girl: Okay.

   Raj: Later, losers!

   Scene: Amy’s lab. Phone rings.

   Amy: Hello? Another medical emergency? What’s wrong with him
   now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider.
   How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone.
   Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove
   over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be
   an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency
   contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have
   a brain tumour. I’m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a
   lot.
