Series 2 Episode 15 – The Maternal Capacitance

   Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Rock Band. Sheldon
   is on guitar, Howard drums and Raj singing. They are performing
   the Red Hot Chili Peppers “Under the Bridge”. As Raj gets into
   the song, Penny enters and his singing turns into a squawk.

   Penny: Fellas, please.

   Howard: Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.

   Penny: You found it. It’s the sound of a cat being run over by
   a lawn mower.

   Leonard (entering on the phone): I’m really very busy. Is there
   any way that we can put this off until I have more time to
   prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.

   Penny: What’s that about?

   Howard: Not a clue.

   Leonard: Can’t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next
   summer?

   Sheldon: This should be fairly easy to deduce. He’s holding the
   phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he’s
   using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the
   brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the
   caller.

   Leonard: No, I didn’t realize it had been so long. Sure, I
   guess there’s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.

   Sheldon: He’s referring to an activity he has done before. It’s
   unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of
   invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.

   Leonard: Aren’t there any other options? There’s not a lot of
   room, it’s gonna be uncomfortable.

   Sheldon: Yes, yes. Yeah, I’m definitely going with colonoscopy.

   Leonard: Okay, bye. My mother’s coming to visit.

   Howard: How about that, you were right.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The lobby. Penny finds a woman studying the lift.

   Penny: It’s out of order.

   Woman: Yes, I can read the sign, I’m just pondering the
   implications.

   Penny: I think it implies that the elevator doesn’t work.

   Woman: Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape
   are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the
   elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of
   time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I
   assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number
   of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a
   shared delusion of functionality.

   Penny: You must be Leonard’s mother.

   Leonard’s Mother: Oh, I don’t know if I must be, but yes.

   Penny: Uh, I’m Penny. I’m his neighbour.

   Leonard’s Mother: Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.

   Penny: Oh, nice to meet you.

   Beverley: Oh, you’re a hand shaker. Interesting.

   Penny: Uh, why don’t you come with me. I’ll walk you to the
   apartment.

   Beverley: Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange
   pleasantries on the way?

   Penny: Yeah, sure, I guess.

   Beverley: All right, you start.

   Penny: Okay. You know, I’ve always been curious. What was
   Leonard like when he was little?

   Beverley: Oh, I think you mean young. He’s always been little.

   Penny: Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?

   Beverley: You’ll have to be more specific.

   Penny: Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.

   Beverley: Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what
   Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development.
   An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of
   his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.

   Penny: Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.

   Beverley: Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is
   neuroscience.

   Penny: Oh, well, I’m an actress.

   Beverley: Why?

   Penny: What do you mean why?

   Beverley: Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go
   into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of
   identity.

   Penny: Yeah, I don’t know what that means.

   Beverley: Well, it means you value yourself only as others
   value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood
   emotional needs.

   Penny: Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.

   Beverley: Tell me about it.

   Slight time shift.

   Penny: I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good
   at sports, but I hated getting dirty!

   Beverley: And then, I’m assuming, you entered adolescence.

   Penny: Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first
   training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I
   wasn’t Slugger anymore. Your mother’s here!

   Beverley: If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find
   out what kind of cologne her father wore.

   Leonard: Good to see you, Mother.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Here’s your tea, Mother.

   Beverley: Oolong?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Beverley: Loose, not bagged?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Beverley: Steeped three minutes?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Beverley: Two-percent milk?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Beverley: Warmed separately?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Beverley: One teaspoon sugar?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Beverley: Raw sugar?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Beverley: It’s cold.

   Leonard: I’ll start again.

   Sheldon: I have the same problem with him. My theory is that
   his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.

   Beverley:  Oh, I don’t know where he would’ve gotten that.
   Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father
   and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.

   Sheldon: That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.

   Beverley: Yes, we think so. We’ve both done papers on it. Mine
   from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an
   anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth
   reading.

   Sheldon: Of course. I would very much like to read about your
   sex life.

   Beverley: Well, it’s all online or you can order it from the
   Princeton University Press.

   Leonard: Here’s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking
   about?

   Sheldon: The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.

   Leonard: Swell. If you’re lucky, maybe she’ll show you the
   PowerPoint presentation.

   Beverley: I’m sorry, it’s on my other laptop.

   Sheldon: Aw…

   Leonard: So, Mother, what’s new?

   Beverley: You’ll have to be more specific.

   Leonard: All right. Uh, what’s new with you?

   Beverley: Oh, well, I’ve been having some fascinating
   menopausal symptoms recently.

   Leonard: Maybe something less personal.

   Beverley: Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.

   Leonard: Oh, my God. What happened?

   Beverley: His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.

   Sheldon: What a remarkable woman.

   Leonard: Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.

   Sheldon: I envy you your childhood.

   Leonard: I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have
   of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.

   Sheldon: You’re clearly misremembering. Your mother is
   brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I’m betting she never
   hit you with a Bible because you wouldn’t eat your Brussels
   sprouts.

   Leonard: Sheldon, you don’t give your mother enough credit.
   She’s warm, she’s loving, she doesn’t glue electrodes to your
   head to measure your brain waves while potty training.

   Sheldon: You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG,
   I had to attach my own electrodes.

   Scene: The university cafeteria.

   Howard: So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his
   incredibly successful brother and sister.

   Leonard: Please, don’t go there, Howard.

   Howard: I understand that unlike Leonard, they’re at the top of
   their respective fields.

   Leonard: Boy, you suck.

   Beverley: Well, Leonard’s younger brother, Michael, is a
   tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just
   successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.

   Howard: So, she’s close to curing diabetes?

   Beverley: Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged
   gibbon?

   Howard: Wow, you must be very proud.

   Beverley: Why? They’re not my accomplishments. I have to
   urinate.

   Leonard: Why are you doing this?

   Howard: You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you
   must suffer.

   Sheldon: Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more
   successful than you.

   Raj: Yeah, you’re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter
   family.

   Howard: Oh, meesa think yousa lookin’ so so sad.

   Leonard: You know, rather than mock me, my friends might
   realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.

   Raj: Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.

   Howard: Next time, don’t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?

   Leonard: That was fast.

   Beverley: Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I’ll have to try
   again later.

   Sheldon: It’s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in
   real estate, it’s location, location, location.

   Beverley: So, where were we?

   Leonard: Howard lives with his mother and Raj can’t speak to
   women unless he’s drunk. Go.

   Beverley: That’s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare.
   On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother
   is so common it borders on sociological cliché.

   Howard: It’s just temporary, I pay rent.

   Leonard: He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.

   Beverley: You know, both selective mutism and an inability to
   separate from one’s mother can stem from a pathological fear of
   women. It might explain why the two of you have created an
   ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.

   Howard: Say what? (Raj whispers in his ear) That’s basically
   what I just said.

   Leonard: You brought your husband to work, you know the rules.
   Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha,
   betcha.

   Beverley: Leonard, it’s one o’clock, weren’t you going to show
   me your laboratory at one o’clock?

   Leonard: There’s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their
   secret love for each other.

   Beverley: But it’s one o’clock, you were going to show me your
   laboratory at one o’clock.

   Sheldon: Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o’clock.

   Leonard: Fine. Let’s go. I think you’ll find my work pretty
   interesting. I’m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal
   found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.

   Beverley: So, no original research?

   Leonard: No.

   Beverley: Well, what’s the point of my seeing it? I could just
   read the paper the Italians wrote.

   Howard: Just for the record, we’re not in an ersatz homosexual
   relationship.

   Raj: Well, then why didn’t you say that to her?

   Howard: Why is it always my responsibility?

   Raj: It’s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the
   same thing you did at the comic book store last week.

   Howard: I can’t believe you’re bringing that up.

   Raj: I didn’t bring it up. You did.

   Howard: We’ll talk about this later.

   Raj: You always say that, but we never do.

   Sheldon: You went to the comic book store without me.7

   Scene: Outside Penny’s door.

   Penny: Hey.

   Leonard: You got alcohol?

   Penny: Your mom still here?

   Leonard: Yep.

   Penny: Come on in. Wait, wait, she’s not gonna come here
   looking for you, is she?

   Leonard: Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a
   brain scan.

   Penny: Oh, my God. What happened?

   Leonard: Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon
   likes getting his brain scanned.

   Penny: Geez, what a fun couple.

   Leonard: She’s only been here a day and a half and I’m
   seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.

   Penny: Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I’ve
   been half bombed ever since.

   Leonard: You can’t let her get into your head.

   Penny: My head, what about yours?

   Leonard: It’s too late for me. My head is her summer house.

   Penny: She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is
   totally exterior to me.

   Leonard: Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.

   Penny: I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning
   with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant
   commercial. And for what? So I’ll finally get my daddy’s
   approval?

   Leonard: Did you get the part?

   Penny: No, they said I was too perky.

   Leonard: Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a
   parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have
   some sensation of human contact?

   Penny: Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn’t let go. Your
   mother told me.

   Leonard: Of course she did. Anyway, that’s not what I was gonna
   say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.

   Penny: A hugging machine?

   Leonard: Yeah. I got a dressmaker’s mannequin, I stuffed it
   with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two
   radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.

   Penny: Oh, that is so sad.

   Leonard: You know what the saddest part was?

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: My father used to borrow it.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Beverley: Your scan data will be very elpful to my research.
   You have a remarkable brain.

   Sheldon: I know. Although I’ve always hated how my right
   frontal lobe looks in pictures.

   Beverley: Common complaint among men. Nothing’s ever big
   enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the
   end of it.

   Sheldon: I’d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.

   Beverley: Oh, I’ll send you a link, but its physiology is
   fairly unimpressive.

   Sheldon: Oh, I can’t believe that.

   Beverley: Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence
   suggests an attempt at flattery.

   Sheldon: My apologies. I’ve been living with your son too long.
   Gotten into some bad habits.

   Beverley: Understandable.

   Sheldon: Can I make you a cup of tea?

   Beverley: I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it’s probably
   you.

   Sheldon: I feel very comfortable around you.

   Beverley: I feel very comfortable around you, too.

   Sheldon: It’s surprising because I generally don’t feel
   comfortable around, well, anyone.

   Beverley: Nor I.

   Sheldon: What are the odds that two individuals as unique as
   ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively
   workaday as your son?

   Beverley: Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do
   the math?

   Sheldon: I’d like to do the math.

   Beverley: I’d like that, too.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny and Leonard are doing tequila
   shots.

   Penny: Okay, now this time…

   Leonard: Uh-huh.

   Penny: You’re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and
   then bite the lime.

   Leonard: I’m sorry, I didn’t hear anything after lick.

   Penny: Neck, shot, lime. (Leonard starts licking her neck. He
   is there a long time) Okay, shot, lime.

   Leonard: Right. Ah! Where’s the lime? (Penny has the lime in
   her mouth) Oh, okay, we’re sharing.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: So, what do you think?

   Beverley: I’m very tempted. I’m just not sure it’s appropriate
   with my son’s roommate.

   Sheldon: Normally, I’d feel the same way. But based on
   everything I’ve observed about us, I can’t help but speculate
   we’d be very good together.

   Beverley: True. I’ve had a similar observation. It’s certainly
   something I could never do with my husband.

   Sheldon: I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I
   experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of
   endorphins. It’s quite satisfying.

   Beverley: I see what you’re doing. You’re appealing to the
   neuroscientific researcher in me.

   Sheldon: You see right through me, don’t you?

   Beverley: Only when you’re in a CAT scanner.

   Scene: Penny’s bedroom. Penny and Leonard are in bed.

   Leonard: This is actually gonna happen.

   Penny: Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.

   Leonard: You shush, I’m happy, I want to talk about it. You
   know what my mother would say about this? She would say because
   you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my
   mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the
   intimacy we didn’t get as children.

   Penny: Why would you bring that up right now?

   Leonard: I don’t know. Foreplay?

   Penny: So you’re saying you’re not having sex with me, you’re
   having sex with your mother?

   Leonard: Ummm, I’m gonna go with “no.”

   Penny: That is the sickest thing I’ve ever heard.

   Leonard: Come on, you’re trying to have sex with your father,
   and I’m okay with that.

   Scene: Penny’s front door.

   Penny: Get out!

   Leonard: She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters
   apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on
   Journey’s “Any Way You Want It” on Rock Star.)

   Scene: The hallway.

   Leonard: All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.

   Beverley: That’s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes
   (gives him a very uncomfortable hug.)

   Penny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, good morning.

   Leonard: Morning.

   Penny: Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.

   Leonard: You don’t have to. Ever.

   Penny: Gotcha.

   Leonard: Good-bye, Mother.

   Beverley: Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up
   where we left off last time?

   Slight time shift.

   Penny (in tears): I mean, my mom could’ve just said, “Bob, get
   over it, she’s a girl, move on.” But she didn’t. Not one word.

   Beverley: Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New
   Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a
   brain scan?

   Penny: Would it help?

   Beverley: Well, it would help me.
