Series 2 Episode 18 – The Work Song Nanocluster

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: Knight to queen’s bishop-five.

   Howard: Oh, very nice. What’s Leonard going to do? Does he give
   up the pawn or does he give up the position?

   Raj: Let’s find out. Leonard, ready?

   Leonard: Ready.

   Raj: Go. (Leonard sprays an aerosol which lights up laser
   beams. He tries to negotiate the beams as Howard and Raj sing
   dramatic music. Eventually he touches one of the beams and a
   buzzer sounds.)

   Leonard: Damn it. I slipped.

   Howard: Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser
   Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You’re up.

   Sheldon: Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol
   disinfectant, I must forfeit.

   Leonard: Why?

   Sheldon: – Because it’s almost eleven o’clock.

   Leonard: So?

   Sheldon: So, Penny has a don’t knock on my door before eleven
   o’clock  or I punch you in the throat rule.

   All: Ah.

   Howard: Hey, you know what’d be a great idea? We get some girls
   over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.

   Leonard: Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to
   play that, you don’t want to see naked.

   Howard: You underestimate me.

   Scene: Outside Penny’s door. Sheldon stands looking at his
   watch with his hand poised to knock. At the right moment he
   starts knocking.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock)
   Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: Hey, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: It’s eleven am.

   Penny: I know. You’re safe.

   Sheldon: This package came while you were at work.

   Penny: Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.

   Sheldon: Excuse me.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: You have to sign this.

   Penny: What is it?

   Sheldon: When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the
   United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I
   now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I’m
   fully indemnified and no longer liable.

   Penny: Sheldon, it’s just a box of rhinestones.

   Sheldon: Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment
   has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?

   Penny: It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you
   what I’m doing.

   Sheldon: Bailment describes a relationship in common law where
   a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is
   transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the
   bailee.

   Penny: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a
   business.

   Sheldon: Obviously, not a cleaning business.

   Penny: No, I’m making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny
   Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work
   wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in
   Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she
   wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a
   $156.

   Sheldon: Good for you. Sign here.

   Penny: Sheldon, don’t you get it? If this takes off, I won’t
   have to be a waitress anymore.

   Sheldon: But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday
   nights?

   Penny: Another waitress.

   Sheldon: What’s her name?

   Penny: I don’t know.

   Sheldon: And you’re going to let her handle my food?

   Penny: Nancy. Her name is Nancy.

   Sheldon: I think you’re just making that up.

   Penny: Sheldon, I’m sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just
   don’t want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.

   Leonard: Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.

   Penny: Fine, cheeseburger.

   Sheldon: Maybe I’d be better off with Nancy.

   Penny: So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business,
   right?

   Sheldon: How many of these can you make a day?

   Penny: About twenty.

   Sheldon: And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?

   Penny: I don’t know, like, 50 cents. I’m not sure.

   Sheldon: No, Of course you’re not. All right, ten dollars a day
   times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand
   six hundred dollars.

   Penny: That’s all?

   Sheldon: Before taxes.

   Penny: Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff.

   Sheldon: I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly
   disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing
   techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you
   might be able to make this a viable business.

   Penny: And you know about that stuff?

   Sheldon: Penny, I’m a physicist. I have a working knowledge of
   the entire universe and everything it contains.

   Penny: Who’s Radiohead?

   Sheldon: I have a working knowledge of the important things in
   the universe. Good luck.

   Penny: Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make
   more money with this?

   Sheldon: Of course I could.

   Penny: Sheldon, wait! Will you?

   Sheldon: Just to be clear here, you’re asking for my
   assistance.

   Penny: Yes.

   Sheldon: And you understand that will involve me telling you
   what to do?

   Penny: I understand.

   Sheldon: And you’re not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me
   while I’m doing so.

   Penny: Okay.

   Sheldon: Good. Let’s begin with the premise that everything
   you’ve done up to this point is wrong.

   Penny: Oh, imagine that.

   Sheldon: Sarcasm. Good-bye.

   Penny: No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment. Penny is making a barette. Sheldon is
   timing her.

   Penny: There. Done.

   Sheldon: All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.

   Penny: Pretty good, right?

   Sheldon: That’s 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost
   of materials and your wholesale selling price, you’ll
   effectively be paying yourself… $5.19 a day.

   Penny: A day?

   Sheldon: There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia
   who outearn you.

   Penny: That just can’t be right.

   Sheldon: You’re questioning my math?

   Penny: No, sorry.

   Sheldon: Want me to show my work?

   Penny: Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about
   it.

   Sheldon: All right, are you familiar with the development that
   resulted from Honoré Blanc’s 1778 use of interchangeable parts?
   The assembly line, of course.

   Penny: Okay, you know what, if I’m not allowed to be snide,
   you’re not allowed to be condescending.

   Sheldon: That wasn’t a part of our original agreement, and I do
   not agree to it now.

   Penny: All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines
   and conveyor belts in my apartment?

   Sheldon: You’re thinking of the moving assembly line, an
   understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving
   assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That
   innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by
   enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that
   isn’t one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.

   Scene: The apartment

   Leonard: Let’s go. We’re going to miss the coming attractions.

   Raj: What’s the matter?

   Howard: I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.

   From Penny’s apartment they hear Penny and Sheldon singing
   “Blow the man down.” They enter to find Sheldon and Penny
   working together on the barettes.

   Leonard: Hello?

   Penny & Sheldon together: Hello. (They resume singing and
   working)

   Leonard: W-W-Wait, what’s going on?

   Sheldon: I assume you’re referring to the sea shanty. It’s a
   rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.

   Penny: Yeah, it’s crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made
   this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.

   Leonard: Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than
   it answers.

   Sheldon: Penny’s making hair accessories. I’m helping her
   optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break’s over.
   (They start singing again.)

   Howard: Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?

   Sheldon: Hot glue.

   Howard: You’re kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a
   better job.

   Sheldon: It won’t work, the flower’s too porous.

   Leonard: What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV
   to provide a better mounting surface?

   Sheldon: Intriguing.

   Howard (after Raj whispers to him): Good question, what are you
   marketing and distribution channels?

   Penny: Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this
   cute, little shop in Old Town.

   Sheldon: Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent.
   I’m thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey
   e-commerce system to start.

   Howard: Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a
   small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.

   Leonard: She’d need some kind of industrial cooling system.

   Sheldon: Of course, but before we set up a marketing and
   distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the
   manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible
   problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.

   Penny: Yeah, it’s a bitch.

   Howard: Uh, I’ve seen this before.

   Leonard: Where?

   Howard: It’s a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat,
   they clump.

   Penny: Ew.

   Leonard: Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium
   sulphate?

   Howard: Actually, I’m thinking about this one stripper named
   Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.

   Sheldon: Let’s think out of the box for a moment. How about a
   molecular sieve?

   Leonard & Howard: Oh!

   Penny: I’ve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.

   Sheldon: Wow.

   Leonard: Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from
   the chem lab.

   Sheldon: Oh, great. Raj, why don’t you and Howard go get the
   charcoal? Leonard, why don’t you start working on some
   preliminary Web site designs. I’ll make some space in our
   apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.

   Penny: Well, what’s wrong with my apartment?

   Sheldon: It’s not my apartment.

   Penny: Wait, wait, what am I going to do?

   Leonard: Uh, hey, it’s your business. Do whatever you want.

   Penny: Oh, okay, cool. I’m going to take a nap.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: I’m still tweaking things a little bit, but this will
   give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys
   think?

   Howard (after Raj whispers to him): Uh, pretty much any way I
   say that is going to hurt his feelings.

   Leonard: Okay, what’s wrong with it?

   Sheldon: – What’s wrong with it?

   Leonard: Not you. I wasn’t asking you. Penny?

   Penny: Uh, well, it’s a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of
   looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.

   Leonard: No, it doesn’t.

   Howard: Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.

   Sheldon: Penny, this is your enterprise, so it’s ultimately
   your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I’d
   strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.

   Leonard: You want to fire me?

   Sheldon: What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny’s decision.
   Penny?

   Leonard: Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we
   already have orders?

   Penny: We do?

   Leonard: Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville,
   Alabama has ordered two.

   Penny: No kidding. Two?

   Leonard: Uh-huh. Look at the comments.

   Penny: Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to
   cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.

   Sheldon: Camouflaging bald spots. That’s primarily a male
   concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.

   Penny: How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?

   Howard: We add Bluetooth!

   Sheldon: Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.

   Penny: Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair
   barrette with Bluetooth?

   Sheldon: Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.

   Leonard: Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny
   Blossoms.

   Penny: Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes
   with rhinestones?

   Leonard: The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay,
   Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.

   Sheldon: Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.

   Howard: And I’ll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.

   Sheldon: We should get to work.

   Penny: Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since
   when do we offer a one-day rush?

   Leonard: Amazon offers one-day rush.

   Penny: Yeah, but they don’t have to glue the books together.
   How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in
   one day?

   Leonard: Don’t yell at me. I’m not manufacturing. I’m just Web
   design.

   Penny: Okay, well, I’m gonna have to call them and cancel the
   order.

   Sheldon: Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial
   independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation?
   My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.

   Penny: I just don’t see how see can pull this off.

   Sheldon: Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and
   self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett
   quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?

   Howard: They didn’t quit. They were massacred by, like, a
   gazillion angry Mexicans.

   Sheldon: Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts
   on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night’s work.

   Penny: You guys get started.

   Leonard: What are you doing?

   Penny: Going online to buy shoes!

   Scene: The same, later. Sheldon and Penny are making barettes,
   singing “She’ll be coming round the mountain.”

   Raj: You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing
   this, I could have stayed in India.

   Howard: Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father’s
   a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.

   Raj: We only had four servants. And two of them were children.

   Leonard: How are we doing?

   Raj: We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.

   Howard: Oh, God, we’re never gonna finish in time. Who made
   Sheldon the boss anyway?

   Sheldon: I believe I’m hearing some negativity on the factory
   floor.

   Penny: So?

   Sheldon: Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must
   be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be
   skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk,
   more work!

   Penny: Nicely done.

   Sheldon: Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.

   Time shift

   Leonard (singing): Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah…

   Howard (reluctantly singing): Someone’s in the kitchen I
   know-ow-ow-ow

   Penny (singing): Someone’s in the kitchen with Dinah… Sheldon?
   Sheldon! (nudges him)

   Sheldon (waking up, singing): ‘Cause I sold my soul to the
   company store.

   Penny: Honey, do you want some coffee?

   Sheldon: No, I don’t drink coffee.

   Penny: Come on, but if you don’t stay awake we’ll never finish
   in time.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, coffee’s out of the question. When I moved
   to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn’t start doing
   drugs.

   Penny: Leonard, help.

   Leonard: Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.

   Sheldon: I have complete faith that you will make them. Good
   night.

   Penny: Leonard?

   Leonard: Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and
   leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.

   Sheldon: You’re right, of course.

   Penny: Here, this will help.

   Sheldon: Very well, but if this leads to opiates or
   hallucinogenics, you’re going to have to answer to my mother.

   Time shift

   Sheldon: Look at Planck’s Constant. People say it’s arbitrary.
   It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly,
   life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let’s
   reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and
   effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe
   that’s not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from
   a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are
   all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in
   front the Red Queen, and we’re being offered a cracker to
   quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let’s
   call it universe prime, there’s another Sheldon, let’s call him
   Sheldon prime…

   Penny: We should have let him go to bed.

   Leonard: Bam.

   Time shift

   Leonard: I can’t believe we actually did it.

   Howard: 1,000 friggin’ Penny Blossoms.

   Penny: I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for
   your help, and for every dollar I make, I’m going to give you
   20 cents.

   Howard: That’s your entire profit margin.

   Penny: Oh. Then never mind.

   Leonard: I’ll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey,
   Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want
   another thousand Penny Blossoms.

   Penny: Really?

   Leonard: One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web
   site.

   Penny: Okay, well. Guess we’d better get started.

   Howard: You can’t be serious.

   Penny: Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce
   and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?

   Leonard: Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.

   Penny: Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I’m tired, I’ve had like 18
   cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we
   can do this. Who’s with me?

   Howard: Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do
   have lives.

   Penny: Leonard?

   Leonard: Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East
   Rutherford, New Jersey.

   Sheldon (entering dressed as The Flash): Zoom, zoom, zoom!
   Where’s the coffee?

   Penny: We’re all out.

   Sheldon: No problem. I’ll be back before this banana hits the
   ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!

   Scene: The apartment. Raj is negotiating the laser beams.
   Sheldon and Howard are singing dramatically.

   Raj (reaching the other side): Yes! (He takes a slice of pizza)

   Howard: Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is
   just stupid.
