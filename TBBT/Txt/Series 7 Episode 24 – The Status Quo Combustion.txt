Series 7 Episode 24 – The Status Quo Combustion

   Scene: The Apartment.

   Leonard: How’s your mom holding up?

   Howard: She’s doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.

   Amy: How many is that now?

   Howard: Two, and I know what you’re thinking, she’s eating
   them.

   Bernadette: She’s just so impossible, they keep quitting.

   Sheldon: So, who’s watching her now?

   Howard: A bowl full of M&M’s with a few Ambien tossed in.

   Raj: What up, guys?

   All: Hello, hey!

   Leonard: Okay. Well, now that everyone’s here, Penny and I have
   some big news. We’re engaged.

   General cheering and congratulations.

   Raj: And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the
   big news.

   General cheering and congratulations.

   Leonard: Hey, hey, what the hell?

   Bernadette: You guys propose all the time. This never happens.

   Penny: You’re right! Yay!

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Raj: Boy, I’m so hungry today. I wonder why?

   Howard: Because you had sex the other night?

   Raj: You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn’t like
   riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.

   Leonard: Hey, buddy.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Leonard: You okay?

   Sheldon: I just got called into President Siebert’s office. The
   university won’t let me switch my field of study to
   inflationary cosmology. They’re forcing me to continue with
   string theory.

   Howard: Why?

   Sheldon: He said it’s why they hired me, it’s, it’s what my
   grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things
   they don’t want to do. He then gave an example of something he
   had to do, even though he didn’t want to, which was look at my
   stupid face.

   Leonard: That’s a rude thing to say, out loud.

   Sheldon: It’s an outrage. Honestly, I’m tempted to leave the
   university.

   Howard: You know, if you’re really serious about that, I hear
   there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old
   and fat.

   Leonard: Whatever you do, just don’t make any rash decisions.

   Sheldon: I don’t know. I am really aggravated.

   Raj: When I’m feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that’s
   just me.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Howard: Oh, come on, give her a chance.

   Nurse: No. Life, it is too short.

   Bernadette: I know you’ve only been here a day and a half, but
   you’re like part of the family. I don’t think the service is
   gonna send any more people.

   Howard: Yeah, maybe it’s time we just release Ma back into the
   sea.

   Bernadette: That’s not helpful.

   Howard: Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that
   we’re gonna be living here the next few months.

   Bernadette: But we have jobs. We can’t baby-sit her 24 hours a
   day.

   Howard: Well, what if we use our vacation time?

   Bernadette: I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.

   Howard: I don’t know what else we can do.

   Bernadette: Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is
   every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a
   divorce.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.

   Leonard: Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.

   Mrs Hofstadter: I’m listening.

   Leonard: Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be
   happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?

   Mrs Hofstadter: No. Let me save you all of your hemming and
   hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.

   Leonard: I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.

   Mrs Hofstadter: Would you like for you and me to talk more?

   Leonard: You know what? It’s probably fine.

   Mrs Hofstadter: In any event, while I’ve had my misgivings
   about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is
   good enough for him, then she’s good enough for me.

   Leonard: I’m your son. What about the fact that she’s good
   enough for me?

   Mrs Hofstadter: Sure.

   Leonard: Thanks, Mom.

   Mrs Hofstadter: Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear
   that your mother approved of your life choices?

   Leonard: Yes, it would.

   Mrs Hofstadter: Yeah. Well, you should work on that.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny (on phone): No, Mom, it’s the same guy I’ve been going
   out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well,
   it’s complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic
   magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a
   date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our
   family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right,
   bye.

   Amy: Atomic magnets?

   Penny: Shut up.

   Bernadette: Sorry I’m late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to
   hand-dry my mother-in-law.

   Penny: You want some wine?

   Bernadette: Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this
   marriage business. You’re not just marrying him, you’re
   marrying his family.

   Penny: I think Leonard’s mom’s okay with me.

   Bernadette: It doesn’t matter if she’s okay with you. The
   question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me
   again.

   Amy: So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?

   Penny: Well, haven’t really talked about it yet, but I figure
   at some point, I’ll move in with him, or he’ll move in with me.

   Amy: Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.

   Bernadette: You’re not working. How would you like a job in
   home health care?

   Penny: Not a chance.

   Bernadette: Please. I’m desperate.

   Penny: No.

   Bernadette: I’ll pay you anything you want.

   Penny: Okay, then, yeah.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Penny: No, keep your money.

   Bernadette: I could’ve ridden a bull longer than that.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: What you working on?

   Sheldon: I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I
   can move on from string theory.

   Leonard: Oh. How’s it going?

   Sheldon: You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may
   know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision
   to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At
   your convenience, I’d be happy to explain it to you in words
   you’ll understand.

   Leonard: It’s nice that you called them esteemed.

   Sheldon: You’re right. I’ll take that out.

   Leonard: So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float
   past you.

   Sheldon: Mm.

   Leonard: Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might
   want to talk about our living arrangements.

   Sheldon: Of course. She’s spent many nights here, and you’re
   worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the
   wedding.

   Leonard: I’m not.

   Sheldon: Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit
   an iceberg, countless men would perish.

   Leonard: Actually, this is about where she and I are going to
   live.

   Sheldon: What do you mean?

   Leonard: Well, well, we might want to live together.

   Sheldon: Oh, yeah, well, I’ve already given this some thought,
   and I’m willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a
   trial period. Now, obviously, not when she’s made cranky by the
   shedding of her uterine lining.

   Leonard: That’s very sweet. But we were thinking more of us
   maybe living together with… not you.

   Sheldon: I don’t understand. How could we all live together if
   I’m not there?

   Leonard: Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that
   sounds scary.

   Sheldon: Where are you going to go?

   Leonard: I don’t know. We just started to think about this.
   Maybe I’ll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I’ll take this
   place, and you can move across the hall.

   Sheldon: Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?

   Leonard: No, I did not.

   Sheldon: Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Well, then, I’m all out of guesses. What? Me move
   across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?

   Leonard: Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life
   she deserves.

   Sheldon: I see. You’re putting your future bride’s happiness
   above mine.

   Leonard: Well, yeah.

   Sheldon: Wow.

   Scene: Amy’s apartment.

   Sheldon: How dare the university force me to go back to string
   theory?

   Amy: They just don’t appreciate you.

   Sheldon: Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to
   suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want
   to live with me any more.

   Amy: Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.

   Sheldon: I have real problems here, Amy. I can’t be mollified
   with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.

   Amy: You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you’re
   always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is.
   Like how he turns up the thermostat when you’re not there.

   Sheldon: Ugh, it’s like walking into the Amazon. And not the
   good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and
   snakes.

   Amy: You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.

   Sheldon: Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?

   Amy: See? Maybe you’ll love living alone.

   Sheldon: I don’t know. Perhaps.

   Amy: And if it turns out you don’t, you and I could live
   together.

   Sheldon: You and… oh, sure, and while we’re at it, why don’t we
   get engaged, too? Why don’t we get a little house, start a
   family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself,
   woman?

   Amy: Sheldon, it was just a thought.

   Sheldon: No. Here’s a thought. You’re not moving in, Leonard’s
   not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by
   the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you’re
   supposed to use the powder.

   Amy: It tastes the same.

   Sheldon: No. The syrup tastes better and I don’t like it.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: This is so sweet. You never cook for me.

   Leonard: Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.

   Penny: If you don’t like my cooking, why haven’t you ever said
   anything?

   Leonard: It’s hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.

   Penny: Sorry. I’ll get better.

   Leonard: I know you’ll try. So, should we talk about setting a
   date?

   Penny: Well, I’d like to pick one that works with my brother’s
   schedule.

   Leonard: Okay. And when would that be?

   Penny: Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good
   behaviour.

   Amy: Hi, is Sheldon here?

   Leonard: No, I thought he was with you.

   Amy: He was, but he stormed off and now he isn’t answering his
   phone.

   Leonard: What happened?

   Amy: He was really angry that you suggested he move out.

   Leonard: Oh.

   Amy: I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he
   was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.

   Leonard: Well, he’s been having a couple of tough days. I’m
   sure he’s fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to
   decompress.

   Amy: You’re probably right. So, what are you guys doing?

   Penny: Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we’re just having a
   nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.

   Amy: That’s nice.

   Leonard: Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a
   little alone time. ‘Cause that’s important. Not just for him,
   but for most anybody, really.

   Amy: Don’t I know it. What is that, polenta?

   Penny: Amy, get out.

   Amy: Right.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Sheldon: No.

   Stuart: Hey, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: What happened?

   Stuart: I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot
   plate caught on fire.

   Sheldon: And you couldn’t put it out?

   Stuart: I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash,
   taking a shower.

   Sheldon: So when will you reopen?

   Stuart: Um, I don’t know. I’m waiting to hear back from the
   insurance company.

   Sheldon: So, tomorrow?

   Stuart: I don’t mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is
   kind of falling apart right now.

   Sheldon: Your life? The university is making me do string
   theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live
   with me. And now, the place I need to go when I’m sad is damp
   and smells funny.

   Stuart: Well, sorry I let you down.

   Sheldon: No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I
   hate it. It stops now. I’m helping you get back on your feet. I
   would like to purchase this comic book, please.

   Stuart: That’ll be $2.99.

   Sheldon: Really? It’s soaking wet.

   Stuart: Fine, a dollar.

   Sheldon: Can you break a twenty?

   Stuart: No, I only have hundreds.

   Sheldon: You know what? I don’t always recognize sarcasm, but I
   do right now, and I don’t appreciate it. I’m sorry for your
   loss. But you’re not the only one whose day has been a
   disaster.

   Stuart: (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a
   moment before) That could have killed me. I can’t catch a
   break.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: I haven’t heard from Sheldon in a while. You think
   he’s okay?

   Penny: Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.

   Leonard: I’m gonna see where he is.

   Penny: How?

   Leonard: Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.

   Penny: You do that?

   Leonard: Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap
   meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.

   Penny: He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger
   danger and gave him that whistle.

   Leonard: That’s weird.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: He’s at the train station.

   Penny: So? He loves trains.

   Leonard: It’s dark out and he’s alone, I don’t like it. Let’s
   go get him.

   Penny: It’s sweet how you look out for him. You’re a good guy.

   Leonard: It’s not just that. My mother would kill me if I let
   something happen to him.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Raj: Dude, I’m so sorry.

   Howard: Don’t take this the wrong way, but did you do this for
   the insurance money?

   Stuart: No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my
   parents, my therapist and the insurance company.

   Raj: We’re here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?

   Stuart: Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your
   place for a few nights.

   Raj: Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the
   night.

   Stuart: You slept with her? Nice.

   Raj: Well, I can’t take all the credit. She let me do it to
   her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.

   Howard: Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some
   money at the same time.

   Stuart: Great.

   Howard: I just have to warn you, it’ll involve humiliation,
   degradation and verbal abuse.

   Stuart: So what’s the catch?

   Scene: The train station.

   Leonard: Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You tracked my phone?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Sheldon: Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.

   Penny: We were worried about you.

   Sheldon: Don’t be melodramatic. I’m just getting on a train and
   leaving forever.

   Leonard: Seriously? You don’t even have a change of clothes or
   a toothbrush.

   Sheldon: My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s
   called living off the land.

   Leonard: Okay, I know you’re upset and there’s a lot of stuff
   going on, but it’s nothing we can’t work out. Come on, let’s
   get you home.

   Sheldon: No. I’ve reached my breaking point. I need to leave.
   Now.

   Penny: And go where?

   Sheldon: It doesn’t matter.

   Leonard: So a few things don’t go your way and your best
   decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?

   Sheldon: I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I
   refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I’d sooner
   die than eat beans out of a can.

   Leonard: Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I’ll, I’ll
   take you to Legoland.

   Sheldon: Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it’s
   too much of a scene since that movie came out.

   Leonard: Then what can I do?

   Sheldon: Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and
   it’s simply too much. I need to get away and think.

   Leonard: Oh, come on, you know you’re overreacting.

   Penny: Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let
   him go.

   Leonard: What? Why?

   Penny: It might be good for him.

   Leonard: You know he can’t take a trip like this by himself.

   Penny: He’s a grown man.

   Leonard: No, he looks like a grown man. You’ve seen Freaky
   Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.

   Penny: Leonard, we can’t protect him forever.

   Leonard: I know, but…

   Penny: He’ll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.

   Sheldon: Good Lord. Padawan’s the student, not the teacher.

   Penny: Seriously, let him go.

   Leonard: Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I’m not gonna
   stand in your way.

   Sheldon: I do.

   Leonard: Okay. Good luck.

   Penny: Be safe and call us.

   Sheldon: I will.

   Leonard: Bye, buddy. Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Yes?

   Leonard: I’m gonna miss you.

   Sheldon: Of course you are.

   Leonard: He just made that easier.

   Penny: Mm.

   Scene: Mrs Wolowitz’s house.

   Stuart: Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this,
   go. Go home.

   Howard: You sure?

   Stuart: Yeah, she’s fed, she took her pills, she’s all tucked
   in and watching TV.

   Bernadette: So, she’s not too much for you?

   Stuart: Are you kidding? I love her, she’s great.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune
   with me?

   Stuart: Coming, Debbie.

   Howard: You call her Debbie?

   Stuart: She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This
   job is a dream come true.

   Howard: Was that a little weird?

   Bernadette: Yeah. I don’t know why, but something about it
   feels unnatural.

   Howard: Okay, let’s go.

   Bernadette: Yep.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Amy (on phone): Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to
   you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.

   Leonard: He’s okay?

   Amy: Actually sounds like he’s doing pretty well.

   Penny: I really think this is gonna be for the best.

   Leonard: Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from…

   Amy: How could you let him go?
