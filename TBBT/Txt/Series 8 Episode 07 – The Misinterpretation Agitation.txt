Series 8 Episode 07 – The Misinterpretation Agitation

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Bernadette: So, what are you working on these days?

   Amy: I’m studying one-celled organisms to try and find the
   neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.

   Bernadette: What would a one-celled organism have to be
   embarrassed about?

   Penny: Same as all of us, getting out of a car without
   underwear.

   Bermadette: Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting
   news.

   Penny: Okay, if it’s sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard
   already told us.

   Bernadette: He was being funny. I’m pretty sure. Anyway, I was
   asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest
   female scientists in California. Isn’t that cool?

   Amy: I think it’s awful.

   Penny: Why would you say that?

   Amy: Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be
   celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what
   kind of message does that send?

   Penny: I think the message is check out the rack on that
   scientist.

   Bernadette: Why can’t someone be thought of as both smart and
   pretty?

   Amy: I just don’t think a professional woman should have to
   flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.

   Penny: Okay, what’s the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a
   sale with a physician, I don’t think it hurts to flirt a
   little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe
   crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the
   girls.

   Amy: Maybe it’s different in the world of sales, but it’s
   already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.

   Bernadette: I was kind of excited about the article, but now
   you’re making me feel bad.

   Penny: No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know,
   maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I
   would’ve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each
   other.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The building foyer.

   Man with Flowers: Thank you.

   Sheldon: No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot
   soldiers of our nation’s commerce. It’s because of people like
   you, people like me can limit our human contact. I’d shake your
   hand, but, well, you know.

   Man: I’m not a delivery man, I’m a doctor. Although I do often
   deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.

   Sheldon: That’s humorous.

   Man: All right.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That
   was also humorous.

   Man: All right.

   Sheldon: Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the
   blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn’t a joke.

   Man: All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes
   sales calls to my office.

   Sheldon: Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do
   that for you.

   Man: I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the
   Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.

   Sheldon: Making the extra effort. Good for you.

   Leonard: Great timing, food just got here.

   Sheldon: Ooh, Siam Palace?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: Uh, extra peanut sauce?

   Leonard: No, but you can have mine.

   Sheldon: Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing
   things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing
   flowers to your fiancée as we speak.

   Leonard: What? Why didn’t you say that first?

   Sheldon: Why didn’t you get extra peanut sauce? We can both
   play this game.

   Leonard: Can I help you?

   Man: Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?

   Leonard: May I ask why?

   Man: Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And,
   uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.

   Leonard: Okay, um, look, I’m pretty sure she didn’t wink at
   you.

   Man: Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched
   my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi,
   two…

   Leonard: I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there’s been a
   misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancée.

   Man: Really? I’ve never seen her wear an engagement ring.

   Raj: Really?

   Man: So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales
   technique?

   Leonard: I think so.

   Man: When will I learn? It’s just like the cute girl at the pet
   store all over again.

   Leonard: Excuse me?

   Man: Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I
   bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was
   always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny.
   You’re a, you’re a lucky man.

   Leonard: Thank you. Sorry.

   Man: Oh, uh, you probably don’t want her to see this. It’s
   unnecessarily graphic.

   Sheldon: Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social
   skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for
   a hot beverage.

   Leonard: He tried to score with Penny.

   Sheldon: So have these two, and they’re having dinner with us.

   Scene: A bar.

   Amy: So, how was work today?

   Bernadette: It was fine, but you’ll be happy to know they
   pulled the sexy scientists article.

   Amy: What happened?

   Bernadette: I don’t know. They just canceled the photo shoot
   and said they’re rethinking it.

   Amy: Well, I’m really sorry, but I think it’s for the best. You
   want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your
   breasts in some magazine.

   Bernadette: I guess. It’s really not that important. Hey, up
   here.

   Amy: Sorry, it’s just we’re, we were talking about them. So,
   look, I, I wasn’t going to say anything, but since you seem to
   be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little
   confession. I’m the reason it was pulled.

   Bernadette: What? How?

   Amy: I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing
   e-mail.

   Bernadette: Amy, what did you say?

   Amy: I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing
   an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let
   alone showing them in various stages of undress.

   Bernadette: Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in
   a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.

   Amy: Well, it doesn’t make a difference, because they agreed it
   was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.

   Bernadette: No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took
   away a chance for me to get some publicity.

   Amy: But it was bad publicity.

   Bernadette: That’s for me to decide, not you.

   Amy: I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do
   affects all of us.

   Bernadette: And I think you don’t like people expressing their
   sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy,
   I’m so sorry. That was over the line.

   Amy: You have a nice night.

   Bernadette: Please don’t go. Up until my vicious attack, you
   were the one in the wrong.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of
   honey.

   Man: Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the
   phasers from the original TV show.

   Raj: Oh, cool.

   Howard: How’d you get that?

   Man: Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.

   Sehldon: Wait a minute. You’ve snipped Gene Roddenberry’s vas
   deferens?

   Man: Yes.

   Howard: Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.

   Man: I don’t like to brag,but, uh, you see, I’m kind of the
   doctor to the stars’ urinary tracts.

   All: Wow.

   Man: Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron’s kidney stone?

   All: Ooh.

   Man: He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a
   Terminator.

   Leonard: That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?

   Man: Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn’t really get
   serious until William Shatner’s bladder infection.

   Sheldon: What’d you get? What’d you get?

   Man: Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but
   either way, it’s pretty cool.

   Raj: I would love to see your collection.

   Man: Anytime. Uh, I’ve got some cool stuff. When I first
   started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but,
   well, you know.

   Howard: We know.

   Raj: Preach.

   Man: Can I ask you a personal question?

   Leonard: Sure.

   Man: Um, I mean, you’re a guy like me, so how’d you get a girl
   like Penny?

   Leonard: Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.

   Sheldon: Oh, please, you know, I’ll tell you how he did it.
   Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a
   drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that
   could not shake him.

   Leonard: I don’t know that I’d call myself an infection.

   Howard: A gallant man would defend his fiancée for being called
   a urethra.

   Leonard: Can we please change the subject?

   Penny: Hi.

   Raj: Well, that didn’t go your way.

   Penny: Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?

   Dr Lorvis: Uh, well, actually I came to see you.

   Penny: Really? Why?

   Leonard: Ah, that’s a good question. Apparently someone was
   being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring,
   causing another someone to show up here thinking the first
   someone might be available.

   Sheldon: Oh, God. Don’t make it so hard on her. Look, the first
   someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the
   delightful Dr. Lorvis.

   Penny: Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so
   sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.

   Dr Lorvis: You touched my arm for two Mississippis.

   Penny: Oh. That’s why you were mumbling Mississippi.

   Leonard: Can we talk in private?

   Penny: Please, yes.

   Leonard: I’ll be right back.

   Sheldon: So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?

   Leonard: So, uh, what’s the deal? You take off your ring when
   you go to work?

   Penny: What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn
   it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.

   Leonard: Why?

   Penny: Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if
   these doctors think I’m single. I did the same kind of thing as
   a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your
   apartment?

   Leonard: Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot
   beverage.

   Penny: You were okay with that?

   Leonard: No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.

   Penny: Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don’t you think
   that’s a little weird?

   Leonard: A little, but he’s basically harmless. He’s actually
   kind of a nice guy.

   Penny: Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to
   socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of
   him.

   Leonard: Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?

   Penny: I can’t do it, he’s my best client.

   Leonard: All right, I’ll get rid of him. But you owe me one.

   Raj: Hey, we’re going to Oliver’s house to see his collection.
   You want to go with us?

   Leonard: Yeah, sure. You owe me.

   Scene: Dr Lorvis’ basement.

   Leonard: Oh, my God.

   Sheldon: Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it’s in
   the basement of a urologist’s house in Sherman Oaks.

   Dr Lorvis: Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I
   go to get away from all my other solitude.

   Howard: Oh, come on. It’s a replica.

   Dr Lorvis: Original.

   Howard: Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.

   Raj: The gun from Hellboy?

   Dr Lorvis: Yup.

   Raj: How did you get it?

   Dr Lorvis: Bought it at auction.

   Raj: Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman’s
   testicles.

   Woman’s voice (off): Oliver, I’m going to play bingo.

   Dr Lorvis: Okay, Mother. Have fun.

   Howard: Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?

   Raj: Yeah, I’m not quite sure how to respond.

   Leonard: Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a
   kid.

   Sheldon: Because it’s a story of a pretty blonde girl
   tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?

   Leonard: No, because I liked it.

   Sheldon: Well, now, don’t get defensive. You’re oddly-shaped,
   but you got the girl.

   Dr Lorvis: So, I’ve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about
   his relationship with Penny.

   Sheldon: Yes. If you’d like to join in, the premise is their
   love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.

   Dr Lorvis: So, you think she’ll be single soon?

   Sheldon: Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you’re too
   late. All the squares have been purchased.

   Dr Lorvis: Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of
   something.

   Sheldon: Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you
   something.

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: I’m still upset about that peanut sauce.

   Scene: The lobby.

   Dr Lorvis: Oh, could you hold the door?

   Amy: Nice flowers.

   Dr Lorvis: Thank you. They’re for a girl. Uh, I’m being
   implacable and relentless.

   Amy: Isn’t she lucky?

   Dr Lorvis: She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we
   both want the same thing.

   Amy: What’s that?

   Dr Lorvis: Unconditional love.

   Amy: I guess that’s all anybody wants.

   Dr Lorvis: I guess so.

   Amy: Well, I hope you get it.

   Dr Lorvis: One Mississippi, two Mississippi.

   Scene: Dr Lorvis’ basement.

   Leonard: Next game, let’s switch helmets.

   Sheldon: No, I’d look silly in that helmet.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Amy: I can’t take these.

   Dr Lorvis: Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had
   two wonderful Mississippis.

   Amy: But what about the other girl?

   Dr Lorvis: Oh, right. I’ll tell her we should just be friends.

   Penny: Dr. Lorvis?

   Dr Lorvis: Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?

   Scene: Dr Lorvis’ basement.

   Raj: You think he bites?

   Howard: Stick your head in there and find out.

   Raj: You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will
   not fool me again.

   Leonard: I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He’s been gone a while.

   Raj: Maybe he’s playing bingo with his mommy.

   Howard: It’s sad how some guys can’t cut the apron strings.

   Raj: Okay, now you’re messing with me.

   Leonard: Uh, guys, we’re locked in here.

   Sheldon: Oh, this day just keeps getting better.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So, you just left them alone playing games in your
   house?

   Dr Lorvis: Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would
   give me time for you and I to get to know each other better.
   That was before we met.

   Amy: We all have a past.

   Penny: Doc, you’ve got to see what you’re doing is, is a little
   creepy.

   Dr Lorvis: You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed
   her into a restroom.

   Penny: Okay, you can’t just go chasing after every girl who’s
   nice to you.

   Dr Lorvis: Well, that’s not what Sheldon says. And he seems to
   know his way around the ladies.

   Penny (on phone): Hey, Leonard. Guess who’s back. Dr. Lorvis.
   Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your
   basement?

   Dr Lorvis: Well, they’re, they’re not locked in. The door just
   sticks.

   Penny: Okay, so how do they unstick it?

   Dr Lorvis: They’d need the key.

   Penny: Okay. Nope. That’s it. We are gonna go over there right
   now, and you are going to let them out.

   Dr Lorvis: Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.

   Penny: Move it.

   Scene: The foyer.

   Bernadette: Oh, good, you’re here. Amy, I am so sorry.

   Amy: That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his
   basement.

   Bernadette: What?

   Dr Lorvis: She seems nice. Who’s she?

   Penny: Just walk.

   Scene: Dr Lorvis’ basement.

   Sheldon: You can do this.

   Raj: One ladder left.

   Leonard: Oh-hom yeah.

   Howard: Yes.

   Leonard: Next level.

   Penny: Leonard, are you okay?

   Leonard: Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.

   Amy: Dr. Lorvis, isn’t there something you want to say?

   Dr Lorvis: Yes. I’m very sorry for locking you in my home.

   Howard: Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the
   hammer.

   Leonard: Got it.

   Penny: Okay, Leonard, let’s go.

   Leonard: Just hang on.

   Dr Lorvis: Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey
   Maguire’s prostate sonogram?

   Amy: Sure.

   Penny: Yeah.

   Dr Lorvis: Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.
