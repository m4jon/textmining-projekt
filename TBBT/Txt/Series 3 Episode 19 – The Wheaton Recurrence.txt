Series 3 Episode 19 – The Wheaton Recurrence

   Scene: Leonard and Penny are in Penny’s bed.

   Penny: Having a little trouble catching your breath there?

   Leonard: No, no, I’m good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this
   is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.

   Penny: Do or do not. There is no try.

   Leonard: Did you just quote Star Wars?

   Penny: I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.

   Leonard: Oh, my God. I’m lying in bed with a beautiful woman
   who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.

   Penny: Oh. Oh. Thank you.

   Leonard: You’re welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.

   Penny: Oh, yeah, no, I, I’m, I’m glad.

   Leonard: Good. Glad is good.

   Penny: Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it’s getting pretty late. We
   should probably go to sleep.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: Okay.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Penny: Hmm.

   Leonard: Yeah, probably.

   Penny: Okay, good night, sweetie.

   Leonard: Good night.

   Credits sequence

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?

   Raj: Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only
   possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a
   Batmobile.

   Sheldon: You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant
   would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And
   for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of
   transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile,
   and then giant ant.

   Leonard: Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit
   around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?

   Howard: What’s with him?

   Sheldon: Perhaps he’s at a sensitive point in his monthly
   cycle.

   Howard: Are you saying he’s man-struating?

   Sheldon: Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century,
   scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men’s hormone
   levels.

   Raj: Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the
   middle of the month. You know what I’m talking about.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Howard: Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?

   Raj: Big or small, I don’t like rabbits. They always look like
   they’re about to say something, but they never do.

   Sheldon: Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would
   support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few
   mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.

   Raj: Maybe that’s what they want to talk about.

   Howard: Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and
   scrotal position?

   Leonard: I honestly don’t care.

   Raj: Really? Because every time we’ve talked about unusual
   animal genitals, you’ve always had some pretty strong and
   controversial opinions.

   Leonard: What do you want from me? I just don’t give a rat’s
   ass.

   Howard: Would that be a giant rat’s ass?

   Sheldon: For the record, giant rats are possible.

   Leonard: Can we please talk about something else? Maybe
   something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?

   Howard: Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being
   a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.

   Sheldon: Of course they are. Leonard’s being one.

   Raj: Maybe he’s having a lover’s spat with Penny.

   Leonard: No, there was no spat.

   Howard: Oh, but something happened.

   Leonard: I don’t want to talk about it.

   Sheldon: But I sense you’re going to and I don’t want to hear
   about it. Excuse me.

   Howard: What’d you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over
   your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?

   Raj: Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her
   panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?

   Leonard: What? No.

   Raj: I’m just asking, dude. It happens.

   Stuart: You guys still on for bowling tonight?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, I’ve prepared some trash talk for
   the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she
   bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.

   Stuart: Oh. Ouch.

   Sheldon: That is what is referred to as a burn on you.

   Howard: Did you ask her to start waxing?

   Leonard: No.

   Raj: Did you start waxing?

   Leonard: No.

   Howard: While making love, did you accidentally spank your own
   ass and cry out Mommy?

   Leonard: I’m walking away from you now.

   Howard: That wasn’t a no.

   Raj: Yeah, I think we’re getting close.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Howard: Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while
   pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.

   Raj: Oh, that would be a good way to go.

   Penny: Hi.

   Leonard: Oh, hey.

   Sheldon: Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven
   o’clock.

   Penny: Oh, right, bowling.

   Leonard: You don’t have to come if you don’t want to.

   Penny: No, no, it’s okay. I mean, let’s face it, you guys would
   get creamed without me.

   Sheldon: We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of
   femininity works to our advantage.

   Penny: It’s always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Sarcasm?

   Penny: Thinly veiled contempt.

   Sheldon: Remember, seven o’clock.

   Penny: Got it.

   Sheldon: Pacific Daylight time!

   Penny: Bite me!

   Sheldon: Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.

   Scene: The bowling alley.

   Howard: I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.

   Sheldon: These are my own bowling shoes.

   Howard: Then what’s with the disinfectant?

   Sheldon: I know where my feet have been.

   Stuart: Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn’t make it,
   so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil
   Wheaton.

   Wil: Hi, Sheldon. How’s it going?

   Sheldon: Well, well, well. If it isn’t Wil Wheaton, the Green
   Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo,
   the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.

   Wil: You’re not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at
   that card tournament, are you?

   Sheldon: I’m the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot
   net, and dot org. What does that tell you?

   Wil: It tells me that I am living rent-free right here
   (pointing at Sheldon’s head). You ready to bowl?

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m ready. I don’t know if Stuart told you what
   you’re up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain
   of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League
   championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also,
   Penny’s pretty good.

   Wil: Great. Then it’s on.

   Sheldon: Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.

   Time lapse.

   Wil: Yes!

   Sheldon: A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling
   pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest
   accomplishment, watch how it’s really done. I am the ball. My
   thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a
   strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.

   Howard: Hey, I just wanted to tell you I’m a big fan.

   Wil: Oh, thanks.

   Howard: I’m sure you’re probably sick of Star Trek questions,
   but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?

   Raj: Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy
   Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.

   Leonard: Chilli cheese fry?

   Penny: Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.

   Leonard: Really? You love them?

   Penny: Yeah, why?

   Leonard: No reason. I’m just glad to hear you’re comfortable
   saying you love something.

   Penny: Do you really want to get into this right now?

   Leonard: Get into what? Why wouldn’t you love the chilli cheese
   fries? They’ve been in your life a long time. They make you
   happy. They deserve to know.

   Penny: Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I
   didn’t know what to say.

   Leonard: Okay, well, now you’ve had some time to think about
   it. So, what do you want to say?

   Penny: I’m not sure.

   Leonard: How can you not be sure?

   Penny: Okay, this isn’t the place to have this conversation.

   Leonard: No, the place to have the conversation was in bed
   after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.

   Penny: Don’t push it, Leonard.

   Leonard: I am not pushing anything.

   Penny: You are. You don’t get to decide when I’m ready to say I
   love you!

   Raj: Ah, the premature I love you.

   Howard: I guessed premature. Does that count?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment door.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock)
   Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: What?

   Sheldon: This is for you.

   Penny: Ice cream?

   Sheldon: I’ve been familiarizing myself with female emotional
   crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she’s upset, she
   says Ach and eats ice cream.

   Penny: Um, Ach.

   Sheldon: If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.

   Penny: Did Leonard send you over here?

   Sheldon: No, we haven’t spoken since your abrupt departure last
   night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer
   Wil Wheaton.

   Penny: Yeah, I’m sorry about that.

   Sheldon: I’m not too proud to admit that I cried myself to
   sleep.

   Penny: Again, I’m sorry.

   Sheldon: And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with
   Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.

   Penny: You’re kidding.

   Sheldon: No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.

   Penny: All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to
   make me feel better?

   Sheldon: The part where I tell you I’ve engineered a rematch
   with Stuart’s team for tonight.

   Penny: Oh, honey, I don’t know. Things are a little weird with
   Leonard right now.

   Sheldon: You want me to remove him from the team? I’m the
   captain, I can do that.

   Penny: No, no, that’s okay. Just let me talk to him, and I’ll
   get back to you.

   Sheldon: When are you going to talk to him?

   Penny: I don’t know.

   Sheldon: He’s in the laundry room now. Now would be a good
   time.

   Penny: You’re not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?

   Sheldon: Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.

   Scene: The laundry room.

   Penny: I think we should talk now.

   Leonard: What? No, it’s okay. We don’t have to talk ’cause
   there’s nothing to talk about. Everything’s good.

   Penny: Really? So, you didn’t get all snarky ’cause I said
   something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?

   Leonard: All right, maybe I overreacted. So we’re in two
   different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I’m a little
   ahead of you. That’s fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense,
   ’cause let’s face it, I’ve been in this relationship two years
   longer than you.

   Penny: Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about
   you. It’s just that I’ve said the L word too soon before, and
   it didn’t work out very well.

   Leonard: Really? I wouldn’t know what that’s like.

   Penny: I’m sorry. You know what I’m talking about, though.

   Leonard: Yeah, I do.

   Penny: So, we’re good?

   Leonard: Yes, that’s what I’m telling you. We are good. We are
   great.

   Sheldon: All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug.
   Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there’s a lot at stake
   here.

   Scene: The bowling alley.

   Sheldon: Attention, all bowlers. I’ve taken the liberty of
   having these made for our rematch.

   Penny: The Wesley Crushers?

   Sheldon: No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley “Crushers.”

   Penny: I don’t get it.

   Leonard: Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton’s character on Star
   Trek.

   Penny: Still don’t get it.

   Sheldon: It’s a blindingly clever play on words. By
   appropriating his character’s name and adding the S, we imply
   that we we’ll be the crushers of Wesley.

   Penny: Okay, I’m sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds
   like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.

   Sheldon: What? No! Again, it’s not the Wesley Crushers. It’s
   the Wesley “Crushers.”

   Howard: You know, if you want it to mean you’re crushing
   Wesley, it’d be the “Wesley” Crushers.

   Sheldon: Do you people even hear yourselves? It’s not the
   Wesley Crushers. It’s not the “Wesley” Crushers. It’s the
   Wesley “Crushers.”

   Wil: Hey, look. They named their team after me.

   Sheldon: No, it’s not the… Never mind.

   Stuart: So, we’re all clear on the bet and the stakes?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a
   fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you
   publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited
   Velikovsky hypothesis.

   Stuart: Ouch again.

   Wil: Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I’m really
   looking forward to wiping the floor with you.

   Sheldon: Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a
   question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

   Time lapse.

   Wil: After you.

   Sheldon: No, after you, as we are currently crushing you,
   Wesley.

   Wil: It’s customary for the player on the right-hand lane to
   bowl first.

   Sheldon: All right.

   Wil: It’s a custom, not a rule.

   Sheldon: I so loathe you.

   Wil: That’s right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.

   Sheldon: That’s not even from your franchise!

   Stuart: I, um, I want you to know that even though we’re on
   opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.

   Penny: Thank you, Stuart. It’s nice to know.

   Stuart: Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good
   relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from
   West Side Story, what’s-his-name and the big blue chick in
   Avatar. I’m gonna bowl now.

   Sheldon: Be the ball, Howard.

   Howard: Leave me alone, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You weren’t the ball.

   Penny: Hey, thanks.

   Leonard: This is fun, huh?

   Penny: Yeah.

   Leonard: It’s good that we got out and did something physical.

   Penny: Mm-hmm.

   Leonard: Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you
   start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That’s not
   what we’re doing tonight. Tonight we’re just throwing a ball at
   some pins.

   Penny: Yeah, that’s right.

   Leonard: Mm-hmm, and someday, we don’t know when, maybe you’ll
   love me back. Ooh, I’m up.

   All (chanting): Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!

   Sheldon: Excuse me. I don’t know who you’re chanting for as I
   am currently the ball.

   All (chanting): The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The
   ball! The ball!

   Sheldon: Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.

   Wil: I’m glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.

   Penny: Oh, yeah, me, too.

   Wil: It’s always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you’re
   not ready for it.

   Penny: Tell me about it.

   Wil: I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her,
   and she said she wasn’t sure. And she strung me along for
   almost two years. It was brutal.

   Penny: Oh, I’m sorry.

   Wil: Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right
   there, put me out of my misery.

   Penny: Really?

   Wil: Yeah, would have been kinder.

   Stuart: Wil, you’re up.

   Wil: Oh, that’s me.

   Sheldon: Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?

   Penny: What are you talking about?

   Sheldon: He’s evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you
   his grandmother died?

   Penny: No!

   Sheldon: Well, if he does, don’t believe it. He’s not above
   playing the dead meemaw card.

   Wil: Yes!

   Sheldon: Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your
   time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction
   will be short-lived.

   Leonard: Penny, you’re up.

   Sheldon: All right, remember, his meemaw’s alive and be the
   ball.

   Penny: Yeah, I got it.

   Leonard: We really need a strike here.

   Penny: I know.

   Leonard: So just take your time and concentrate.

   Penny: Leonard, stop pressuring me.

   Leonard: I’m not pressuring you.

   Penny: Yeah, you are! Just back off!

   Leonard: Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll shut up.

   Penny: I didn’t mean shut up.

   Leonard: Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.

   Penny: No, this isn’t fair to you, Leonard. I’m sorry.

   Sheldon: Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I’ll get
   you ice cream!

   Leonard: No, let her go.

   Sheldon: Are you insane? If she leaves, it’s over!

   Leonard: I’m pretty sure it’s already over.

   Wil: Tough luck, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: You did this, didn’t you?

   Wil: Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win
   a bowling match?

   Sheldon: No, I suppose not.

   Wil: Good. Keep thinking that.

   Sheldon: Wheaton!

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Stuart: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I’m telling you the Match.com
   chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta
   call you back. I won a bet, and it’s time to collect.

   (The guys enter dressed as female superheroes. Howard is
   Batgirl, Sheldon is Wonder Woman, Leonard is Supergirl and Raj
   is Catwoman.)

   Raj: I don’t know about you, but I feel empowered.
