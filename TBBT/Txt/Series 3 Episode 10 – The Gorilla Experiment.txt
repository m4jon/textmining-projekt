Series 3 Episode 10 – The Gorilla Experiment

   Scene: The apartment

   Penny: Hey, Leonard, check this out. (Throws some food in the
   air and catches it in her mouth)

   Sheldon: Leonard, she’s doing it again.

   Leonard: I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.

   Sheldon: No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it
   from the containers without regard for its equitable
   distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.

   Penny: You want me to put it back?

   Sheldon: Leonard.

   Leonard: It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.

   Howard (arriving): What’s up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I
   want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Howard: Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.

   Leonard: Yeah. Hey.

   Howard: Bernadette, say fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles.

   Bernadette: I don’t think I can. I don’t have Howard’s street
   cred.

   Howard: I hope it’s all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette
   she could join us for dinner.

   Leonard: Sure. The more, the merrier.

   Sheldon: Wait, no, that’s a false equivalency. More does not
   equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right
   now, would we be celebrating? No, we’d be suffocating.

   Leonard: Sheldon…

   Sheldon: Don’t Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.

   Penny: Oh, come on, it’s fine. We’ll just put it all on the
   table, you know, family style.

   Sheldon: Oh, sure. And while we’re at it, why don’t we put our
   hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?

   Leonard: Relax, it’ll be fine, sit down, you guys.

   Everyone: NO!

   Bernadette: What?

   Penny: Oh, yeah, you can’t sit there.

   Bernadette: Why not?

   Leonard: That’s where Sheldon sits.

   Bernadette: He can’t sit somewhere else?

   Penny: Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close
   enough to the radiator so that he’s warm, yet not so close that
   he sweats. In the summer, it’s directly in the path of a
   cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It
   faces the television at an angle that isn’t direct, so he can
   still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks
   distorted.

   Sheldon: Perhaps there’s hope for you after all.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: A few moments later.

   Bernadette: Ooh, I love your shoes.

   Penny: Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren’t they?

   Bernadette: Where’d you get them?

   Penny: Shoes for Less.

   Bernadette: I’ve been meaning to go over there.

   Penny: Oh, great selection, great prices.

   Sheldon: My mother was right. Hell is real.

   Howard: Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.

   Penny: Womenfolk?

   Howard: Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?

   Penny: Just eat your dinner.

   Bernadette: Don’t take him too seriously, a lot of what he says
   is intended as humour.

   Penny: Yeah, well, I don’t think it’s very funny.

   Bernadette: Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.

   Penny: Howard, never let her go.

   Bernadette: So, Leonard, Howard says you’re working on
   fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.

   Leonard: I am. Are you interested in physics?

   Bernadette: Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn’t gone into
   microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice
   dancing.

   Leonard: Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum
   interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right
   now, we’re testing the phase shift due to an electric
   potential.

   Bernadette: That’s amazing.

   Sheldon: Yes. Leonard’s work is nearly as amazing as third
   graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. (Raj whispers
   to him) While I appreciate the oh, snap, I’m uncomfortable
   having your moist breath in my ear.

   Bernadette: Are you going to try to set up the voltages using
   tunnel junctions?

   Leonard: Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?

   Bernadette: Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most
   exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.

   Sheldon: Howard?

   Howard: Yeah?

   Sheldon: Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?

   Howard: What?

   Sheldon: Bazinga. I don’t care.

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon and Raj are playing a racing game
   on the Wii.

   Raj: Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.

   Sheldon: That’s not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.

   Raj: And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it’s a real
   car or a virtual cartoon car, you can’t drive.

   Sheldon: Just need a little more practice.

   Raj: What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic
   genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.

   Penny (knocking and entering): Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you
   for a second?

   Sheldon: It’s not about shoes, is it? I don’t think I could go
   through that again.

   Penny: It’s not about shoes.

   Sheldon: Then speak.

   Penny: Um, actually, can we do it in private?

   Sheldon: All right. (To Raj) Go away. I agree, it’s rude, but
   she asked for privacy.

   Penny: Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here’s the thing, I was wondering
   if you could maybe teach me a little physics?

   Sheldon: A little physics? There’s no such thing. Physics
   encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to
   supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.

   Penny: Yeah, okay, cool. I don’t need the PBS special, I just
   want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You
   know, like Bernadette does.

   Sheldon: Why can’t Leonard teach you?

   Penny: ‘Cause I want to surprise him.

   Sheldon: Can’t you surprise him in some other way? For example,
   I’m sure he’d be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your
   apartment.

   Penny: Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.

   Sheldon: Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my
   time is both limited and valuable.

   Penny: You’re sitting here playing video games all day.

   Sheldon: Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did
   you take any science classes in school?

   Penny: Sure. I did the one with the frogs.

   Sheldon: The one with the frogs.

   Penny: Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls
   threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, Penny, I don’t think so.

   Penny: Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it’ll be a challenge.
   You can make it like an experiment.

   Sheldon: Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign
   language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some
   rudimentary physics.

   Penny: Great! It’s a little insulting, but great. I’ll be KoKo.

   Sheldon: Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000
   words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.

   Scene: The university cafeteria.

   Howard: Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My
   girlfriend Bernadette.

   Bernadette: Who are all those people?

   Howard: Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.

   Bernadette: Hi.

   Leonard: Hey, look, it’s Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.

   Howard: Thought I’d give the little woman a tour of the old
   salt mines.

   Bernadette: He doesn’t mean salt mines. He means where he
   works.

   Leonard: Yeah, no, I got it.

   Bernadette: So, how’s your experiment going?

   Leonard: Ah, terrific. We’re getting the electron accelerator
   set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.

   Bernadette: Boy, I’d love to see that.

   Leonard: You’re welcome to come.

   Bernadette: Really? Oh, that’d be great. How exciting is that?

   Howard: Like Hanukkah in July.

   Bernadette: Do they have that?

   Howard: No.

   Bernadette: Oh. You got me again. This isn’t non-fat yogurt,
   this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.

   Howard: Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?

   Bernadette: Sure.

   Howard: Thanks, honey. (She goes) All right, what is your deal?

   Leonard: Excuse me?

   Howard: Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron
   accelerator?

   Leonard: Yeah? So?

   Howard: Wow! You really are a piece of work. It’s not enough
   you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the
   decorating committee, too?

   Leonard: What are you talking about?

   Howard: Don’t play innocent with me. I practically invented
   using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.

   Leonard: Has it ever worked?

   Howard: Not so far, but that’s not the point!

   Leonard: Howard, relax, I’m not interested in your girlfriend.

   Howard: I hope not, because you don’t want to mess with me. I’m
   crazy.

   Leonard: I believe you.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Research journal, entry one. I’m about to embark on
   one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching
   Penny physics. I’m calling it Project Gorilla.

   Penny: Hey, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I’ve
   extended a friendly casual greeting.

   Penny: Ready to get started?

   Sheldon: One moment. Subject appears well-rested and
   enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us
   begin. Where’s your notebook?

   Penny: Um, I don’t have one.

   Sheldon: How are you going to take notes without a notebook?

   Penny: I have to take notes?

   Sheldon: How else are you gonna study for the tests?

   Penny: There’s gonna be a test?

   Sheldon: Tests. Here. It’s college-ruled. I hope that’s not too
   intimidating.

   Penny: Thank you.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is
   physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika.
   It’s at this point that you’ll want to start taking notes.
   Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there,
   in ancient Greece, that our story begins.

   Penny: Ancient Greece?

   Sheldon: Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It’s a
   warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you’ve finished your
   shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the
   night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so
   you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?

   Penny: Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard’s work?

   Sheldon: This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year
   journey we’re going to take together from the ancient Greeks
   through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the
   Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.

   Penny: Twenty six hundred years?

   Sheldon: Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it’s a warm
   summer evening in ancient Greece… Yes, Penny?

   Penny: I have to go to the bathroom.

   Sheldon: Can’t you hold it?

   Penny: Not for twenty six hundred years.

   Sheldon: Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.

   Scene: Howard’s bedroom.

   Bernadette: Howard?

   Howard: Huh?

   Bernadette: It unhooks in the front.

   Howard: Oh, that explains a lot.

   Howard’s Mother: Howard, I’m home!

   Howard: Of course.

   Howard’s Mother: Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you
   can forget how to ride a bike. I’m fine, but, oy, did Sam
   Harpootian eat gravel.

   Howard: That’s great, Ma!

   Howard’s Mother: What’s great about an 80-year-old Armenian man
   with half his chin scraped off?

   Bernadette: I guess I should go.

   Howard: No, no, don’t move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for
   dinner?

   Howard’s Mother: Lamb stew? I’d have to go to the supermarket.

   Howard: Please? I got a real hankering.

   Howard’s Mother: Oh, I can’t say no to my little tushy face.
   I’ll be back soon.

   Howard: Thanks, Ma.

   Howard’s Mother: Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?

   Howard: Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!

   Howard’s Mother: You’re right! When you’re right, you’re right!
   What if they’re out of the Le Seur?

   Howard: Then get the regular!

   Howard’s Mother: All right! You don’t have to yell!

   Howard: Sorry about that.

   Bernadette (her phone chimes): Let me just put that on vibrate.

   Howard: I’m already on vibrate.

   Bernadette: You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say
   something to Leonard about me?

   Howard: Uh, what do you mean?

   Bernadette: He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it
   might weird you out.

   Howard: Really? He said that?

   Bernadette: You’re not jealous of Leonard, are you?

   Howard: Me? No. I may have mentioned that it’s a little
   inappropriate to be asking another man’s girlfriend to his
   experiment without first discussing it with said man.

   Bernadette: Are you saying I need to ask your permission to
   hang out with Leonard?

   Howard: I didn’t say anything like that. I said Leonard has to
   ask my permission. (Bernadette storms out) Come on, I don’t
   want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on
   the bra.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was
   wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let’s
   plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get
   force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second
   per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know
   from this?

   Penny: Uh, we know that… Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh!
   Is that where Fig Newtons come from?

   Sheldon: No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in
   Massachusetts. Don’t write that down!

   Penny: Sorry.

   Sheldon: Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?

   Penny: I don’t know.

   Sheldon: How can you not know? I just told you. Have you
   suffered a recent blow to the head?

   Penny: Hey! You don’t have to be so mean!

   Sheldon: I’m sorry. (Smiling) Have you suffered a recent blow
   to the head?

   Penny: No, you just suck at teaching.

   Sheldon: Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the
   most likely?

   Penny: Oh, God, Sheldon, look I’m trying to understand, but
   you’re going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?

   Sheldon: All right. It’s a warm summer evening in ancient
   Greece…

   Penny: Not that far back!

   Sheldon: Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?

   Penny: I don’t know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?

   Sheldon: Greece.

   Penny: Damn it!

   Sheldon: There’s no need to get frustrated, people learn at
   different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which…? MA
   equals MG?

   Penny: Squared?

   Sheldon: No.

   Penny: Aristotle?

   Sheldon: No.

   Penny: Five?

   Sheldon: Oh!

   Penny: Then I don’t know.

   Sheldon: Why are you crying?

   Penny: Because I’m stupid!

   Sheldon: That’s no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad.
   For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me
   sad.

   Penny: Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this
   extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?

   Sheldon: All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why
   sub-atomic particles move the way they do.

   Penny: Really? That’s it? Well, that doesn’t sound so
   complicated.

   Sheldon: It’s not. That’s why Leonard does it.

   Penny: Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are
   sub-atomic particles?

   Sheldon: A good question.

   Penny: Thank you.

   Sheldon: And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is
   physics?

   Penny: Oh, balls.

   Sheldon: It’s a warm summer evening in ancient Greece…

   Scene: Leonard’s lab.

   Howard: Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.

   Leonard: What did I do now?

   Howard: I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.

   Leonard: What?

   Howard: We were completely naked, about to devour each other
   when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out
   with you.

   Leonard: You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.

   Howard: Yeah, but that’s not what you tell her.

   Leonard: What was I supposed to tell her?

   Howard: I don’t know, something that doesn’t make me come off
   as a petty, jealous douche.

   Leonard: And what would that be?

   Howard: Come on, do I have to think of everything?

   Bernadette: Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment?
   Oh, hi.

   Howard: Hi.

   Bernadette: What are you doing here?

   Howard: Same thing you’re doing here. I came to see Leonard’s
   experiment.

   Bernadette: No, you didn’t. You said Leonard’s experiment was
   stupid.

   Leonard: You told her my experiment was stupid?

   Howard: I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let’s not get
   off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell
   you who you should be friends with.

   Leonard: Should I, um, leave you two alone?

   Bernadette: No, Leonard, you should hear this.

   Leonard: Okay, good, ’cause I wasn’t really gonna go.

   Howard: Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but
   the truth is I’m not.

   Leonard: We’re shocked.

   Howard: Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.

   Leonard: Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.

   Howard: But I now realize how foolish that is.

   Leonard: He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck
   in a sweater.

   Howard: It was a full turtleneck. Why aren’t you helping me?

   Leonard: I don’t know. Maybe because I’m crazy?

   Howard: Bernadette, please, I’m asking you to give me another
   chance.

   Bernadette: What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him
   another chance?

   Leonard: It’s up to you. He didn’t call your experiment stupid.

   Bernadette: Come here, tushy face.

   Leonard: Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Bernadette: Raj, you should’ve seen Leonard’s experiment. The
   interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.

   Leonard: I’m glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren’t that
   interested in what I do.

   Penny: Actually, that’s not true, Leonard. In fact, recently
   I’ve been thinking that given the parameters of your
   experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the
   nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than
   the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their
   observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the
   metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric
   analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect.
   That’s it. That’s all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named
   after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.
