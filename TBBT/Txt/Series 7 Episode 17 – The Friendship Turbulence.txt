Series 7 Episode 17 – The Friendship Turbulence

   Sceme: The apartment

   Bernadette: Raj, your tag’s sticking out.

   Raj: Thank you. That was the closest I’ve come to sex in, like,
   two years.

   Bernadette: Now I feel a little gross.

   Raj: You’re only making it seem more real for me.

   Howard: Hey, that’s my wife. If anyone’s gonna make her feel
   gross about sex, it’s me.

   Raj: Can we please talk about something other than my
   depressing love life?

   Sheldon: How about Penny’s depressing acting career?

   Leonard: Hey. I mean, it’s been a little tough, but Penny’s
   following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.

   Penny: Aw, thank you.

   Howard: Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?

   Raj: Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.

   Amy: Can I borrow it when you’re done?

   Penny: Well, I’ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a
   movie last week.

   Leonard: Why would you do that?

   Penny: Because it was crap. It’s a sequel to that awful killer
   gorilla movie I was in.

   Bernadette: Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.

   Sheldon: She does. 42 minutes in.

   Raj: While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt
   during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.

   Sheldon: I have an eidetic memory. I don’t know what his
   problem is.

   Penny: Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They
   just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with
   the ape’s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla
   hands and feet.

   Sheldon: Am I missing something, or isn’t that the part she was
   born to play?

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: So are you really not gonna do this movie?

   Penny: Well, I don’t think it’s the kind of part that’s good
   for my career.

   Leonard: Well, but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start
   doing bad movies?

   Penny: Okay, I don’t think Meryl Streep ever had to say “Must
   keep gorilla hands from killing again!”

   Raj: If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no
   wrong.

   Leonard: I don’t know anything about show business, so if you
   think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn
   through your savings, I’m sure you know what you’re doing.

   Amy: I think we’re gonna go.

   Sheldon: Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We
   didn’t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard’s.

   Howard: Hey, I work at the same university you do.

   Sheldon: Yes, and Hawkeye’s in the Avengers, but no one ever
   says help, Hawkeye.

   Bernadette: Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel
   the need to put down my husband?

   Penny: Oh, I’m sure he does it out of love. The same way my
   boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.

   Amy: I think we’re gonna go.

   Leonard: No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited
   that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that
   you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it’s
   a fight.

   Sheldon: Well, with that sorted out, I’m happy to answer your
   question, Bernadette. Howard started it.

   Howard: I didn’t do anything. I was just sitting here.

   Sheldon: I wasn’t referring to this evening. Ten years ago,
   upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like
   C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.

   Raj: Ha-a-a. Still funny.

   Bernadette: That was ten years ago.

   Sheldon: Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed
   that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs
   of nude fat women bending over.

   Amy: Really?

   Howard: The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That’s funny.

   Raj: I was there. It was funny.

   Sheldon: In any event, that began a decade-long progression of
   insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this
   day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which,
   other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.

   Scene: The street

   Amy: Thanks for walking me to my car.

   Raj: Actually, it’s for both of us. Last night, I watched West
   Side Story, and I’m a little freaked out by street gangs.

   Amy: Why can’t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.

   Raj: I don’t appreciate your sarcasm, but we’ve still got two
   blocks to go, so I’ll put up with it.

   Amy: Whatever happened with your online dating?

   Raj: No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my
   profile.

   Amy: Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I
   even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.

   Raj: It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.

   Amy: Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.

   Raj: What? You’ve kissed, like, once in three years.

   Amy: That’s true. Do whatever you want.

   Scene: Sheldon’s office.

   Howard: Hey.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Howard: Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to
   be better friends.

   Sheldon: Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.

   Howard: Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and
   she made some great points. You and I have known each other a
   long time, and I didn’t hear the rest ’cause she took her bra
   off.

   Sheldon: Very well. How do you propose we move forward?

   Howard: Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.

   Sheldon: That’s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new
   arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.

   Howard: Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in
   Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette
   can’t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and
   I’ll show you around the space centre.

   Sheldon: I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in
   Houston and you’ve made up wanted posters that have my face
   with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and
   deported to South America?

   Howard: No.

   Sheldon: I’m glad because I would not have seen that coming.

   Scene: Amy’s lab.

   Raj: Amy, I could use some help.

   Amy: Oh. Let me guess. There’s an undergrad in a leather jacket
   snapping his fingers by the water fountain.

   Raj: I thought about what you said last night, and I went back
   on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl’s
   profile. She’s amazing.

   Amy: Oh, she’s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.

   Raj: And judging by her lack of Adam’s apple, she’s been female
   her entire life. I like that in a woman.

   Amy: Great, so what do you need me for?

   Raj: Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I
   wanted to run it by you first.

   Amy: All right.

   Raj: Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.

   Amy: Wow.

   Raj: I know. Powerful stuff, huh?

   Amy: No. You’re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and
   creepy.

   Raj: Okay, I’m getting some mixed messages here.

   Amy: Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks
   like we have a lot in common, let’s get a cup of coffee
   sometime.”

   Raj: Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby
   lips. Or you just write it for me.

   Amy: I’m not gonna pretend to be you.

   Raj: I don’t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my,
   uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked
   me up.

   Amy: Well, what would I say to her?

   Raj: Just tell her what I’m really like. And, if you think
   it’ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package
   reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own
   words.

   Scene: Penny’s car.

   Sheldon: Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.

   Penny: Oh, it’s no problem. Is everything okay?

   Sheldon: Oh, I’m fine. It’s just some, uh, stomach medication
   for my trip. There’s the remote yet distinct possibility that I
   may end up in South America.

   Penny: Remember the old days when I would’ve said something
   dumb like why? Uh, that doesn’t sound good.

   Sheldon: Remember the old days when I used to point out that
   your check engine light was on?

   Penny: Yes.

   Sheldon: Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny,
   your check engine…

   Penny: Yeah, I know it’s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I
   cannot afford this right now.

   Sheldon: Maybe it’s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the
   light just went out.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Are we playing individual or teams?

   Raj: Teams are fun.

   Sheldon: Oh, in that case, I’d like to be partnered with my
   good friend Howard.

   Raj: But I’m always on Howard’s team. We’re best friends. The
   kind who finish each others…

   Howard: I really don’t think we do tha…

   Raj: Do that. See?

   Penny: Oh, hi.

   Leonard: Oh, how’d it go at the mechanic?

   Penny: Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?

   Leonard: Yeah, sure.

   Raj: Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?

   Howard: Isn’t it a little late to get plane tick…

   Raj: Plane tickets? Yeah.

   Howard: Will you please sto…

   Raj: Stop that? Okay.

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Penny: I don’t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it’s
   totaled. I can’t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I
   can’t drive to auditions.

   Leonard: I’m so sorry. I know it’s a sensitive subject, but can
   you reconsider that part in the movie?

   Penny: I did. I called them. The part’s gone. They gave it to
   someone else. Now that girl’s gonna get discovered and become
   famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big
   break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl
   thought it was beneath her.

   Leonard: At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on,
   I can drive you wherever you need to go.

   Penny: How? Unlike me, you have a job. I’m just gonna have to
   go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my
   life.

   Sheldon: Leonard, would you wrap it up? We’re waiting on you.

   Penny: I’m sorry, is the fact that my life’s falling apart
   interfering with your board game?

   Sheldon: It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely
   understood.

   Scene: Amy’s lab.

   Raj: Hey, you busy?

   Amy: No. What’s up?

   Raj: Have you heard back from Emily?

   Amy: I have.

   Raj: Great. And?

   Amy: And I’m afraid she doesn’t think you’re right for her.

   Raj: I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete
   stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.

   Amy: I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was
   a bad sign that you didn’t write to her yourself. She thought
   it made you seem too shy and passive.

   Raj: I’m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell
   her I said that. You know, when you have a second.

   Amy: Look, I’ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.

   Raj: What’s happening tomorrow night?

   Amy: I’m meeting her for coffee.

   Raj: What?

   Amy: Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we
   kind of hit it off.

   Raj: I find a girl I like, and you’re stealing her?

   Amy: No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to
   Harvard, we like Chaucer, we’re both hardcore into quilting.

   Raj: Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my
   heart.

   Scene: Bernadette’s car.

   Howard: That’s Sheldon. He says he’ll be down in a minute.

   Bernadette: What are you doing?

   Howard: Oh, he’s not coming out until he sees proof you don’t
   have an air freshener in your car.

   Bernadette: This is gonna be a long weekend for you.

   Howard: You’re the reason I’m doing it.

   Bernadette: I said to stop insulting each other. I didn’t tell
   you to take him on a romantic getaway.

   Howard: How do I know what you said? Damn you and your
   noise-cancelling breasts.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Bernadette: Hi.

   Howard: Hey, buddy.

   Bernadette: You excited for Texas?

   Sheldon: Oh, very much so.

   Howard: It’s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real
   astronaut.

   Sheldon: Oh, who’s the real astronaut?

   Howard: Buzz Aldrin.

   Sheldon: Oh. Yay.

   Scene: An airplane.

   Sheldon: (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap,
   tap, tap) Howard?

   Howard: What now?

   Sheldon: I have to go to the bathroom.

   Howard: You just went to the bathroom.

   Sheldon: But I didn’t use it because it didn’t seem safe.
   Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn’t have a seatbelt.

   Howard: Well, it still doesn’t.

   Sheldon: I realize that, but safety concerns went out the
   window two apple juices ago.

   Howard: Fine.

   Sheldon: Why are you getting annoyed?

   Howard: I’m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly
   say and do irritating things.

   Sheldon: Like when?

   Howard: When? How about in the car? I’m an astronaut, and you
   know it. You just don’t like admitting it, because you’re
   jealous.

   Sheldon: Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going
   to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to
   go, it was hard for me.

   Howard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: Because it made me realize they’ll just send anyone up
   there. Aren’t you going to let me out?

   Howard: No.

   Sheldon: But I still need to use the bathroom.

   Howard: Here you go. Be creative. What’s the matter? Scared of
   a little turbulence?

   Sheldon: No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal
   temperature variations in the atmosphere. I’m not scared at
   all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.

   Howard: Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was
   plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real
   astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.

   Sheldon: I take it back. I’m scared of turbulence!

   Howard: I’m gonna need that bag back.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: You sure you want to do this?

   Penny: Yeah. Why wouldn’t I want to get my old job back? It’ll
   be fun to see everyone. I haven’t talked to them since I said I
   quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let’s just get
   this over with.

   Leonard: Let’s get this over with. Am I driving you to the
   Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I’m just, I’m trying
   to lighten the mood.

   Penny: I know. Thank you.

   Leonard: Sorry.

   Penny: It’s just so humiliating.

   Leonard: So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake
   Factory…? I’m sorry. I’ll. I’ll stop. I’ll stop.

   Scene: Outside the building.

   Leonard: Come on, don’t look so sad. You never know what’s
   gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.

   Penny: Sweetie, I know you’re trying to make me feel better,
   and I love you for that, but it’s making me feel worse, and I
   kind of hate you. This isn’t your car.

   Leonard: I know. I thought we’d take yours.

   Penny: I don’t understand.

   Leonard: It’s nothing fancy, but it’ll get you to auditions,
   and at least for now, you don’t have to go back to waitressing.

   Penny: I don’t know what to say.

   Leonard: Don’t say anything.

   Penny: Oh, my God.

   Leonard: I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a
   car.

   Scene: A coffee shop.

   Amy: Look, I admit that it’s odd that Rajesh didn’t write to
   you himself, but if you get to know him, you’ll see he’s just a
   sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited
   and visibly sweaty.

   Raj: Hello, Emily.

   Emily: Hello.

   Raj: Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive
   and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in
   here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower,
   what’s up?

   Emily: No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.

   Raj: Uh, okay, that’s a separate issue. Let’s put a pin in that
   and just focus on the passive thing.

   Emily: I’m leaving.

   Amy: Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?

   Emily: You know, I think I’m just gonna go by myself.

   Raj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.

   Scene: The airplane.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to
   you.

   Howard: I’m sorry, too. It’s all my fault.

   Sheldon: If you weren’t my friend, there’d be a hole in my
   life.

   Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as
   big.

   Announcement: The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt
   sign. You’re now free to move about the cabin.

   Howard: It’s over.

   Sheldon: Yeah.

   Howard: Should we stop holding hands now?

   Sheldon: In a minute.

   Howard: Okay, good.
