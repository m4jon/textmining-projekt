Series 7 Episode 06 – The Romance Resonance

   Scene: The Cheesecake Factory

   Penny: What are you working on?

   Sheldon: Can’t talk. In the zone.

   Penny: Do you know what he’s doing?

   Amy: Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured
   out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he
   was making a list of who’s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever
   gets one. Still can’t believe I didn’t make the cut.

   Penny: Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food’s
   ready.

   Leonard: No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet.
   It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.

   Howard: Sorry we’re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.

   Bernadette: Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the
   species barrier and now can infect humans.

   Raj: Why is that great news?

   Bernadette: In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying,
   mo’ infections, mo’ money.

   Howard: Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands
   first.

   Bernadette: Oh, calm down. If I had it, I’d be dead already.

   Howard: Guys, listen up.

   Sheldon: Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care.

   Howard: Next week is the anniversary of my first date with
   Bernadette.

   Sheldon: Really don’t care.

   Howard: I want to do something special, and I was hoping you
   guys could be a part of it.

   Penny: Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?

   Howard: Just putting something in the bank for what horrible
   thing I do next.

   Penny: Ah.

   Howard: Look, she’s gonna be back any second, so here’s the
   deal. I’m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it
   for her together.

   Leonard: Aw.

   Amy: Oh, I love that.

   Raj: That is so beautiful.

   Howard: Sheldon?

   Sheldon: When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?

   Credits sequence

   Scene: The stairwell

   Leonard: It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for
   Bernadette.

   Penny: Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic
   to celebrate our first date?

   Leonard: Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many
   times, which first date are we talking about?

   Sheldon: Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the
   zone.

   Leonard: And besides, I do romantic things for you all the
   time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?

   Penny: I can name tons.

   Leonard: Sex doesn’t count.

   Penny: Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?

   Leonard: Well, I took you there. All you did was…

   Penny: I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that
   rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.

   Leonard: It’s fine. And also not true.

   Penny: Okay, just you wait and see. I’m gonna romance your
   freakin’ ass off.

   Leonard: That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?

   Penny: Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Zone.

   Leonard: He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want
   some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but
   you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried.
   Please say something.

   Sheldon: Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory
   of my genius.

   Leonard: Nope, it was better before.

   Sheldon: Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And
   it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and
   covered in goop.

   Leonard: Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method
   for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?

   Sheldon: Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done
   that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his
   brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his
   brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his
   brain…

   Leonard: Yeah, definitely better before.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Howard: So I’m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are
   you cool playing the cello?

   Leonard: If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you
   mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello.

   Howard: Great. Will you play the ukulele?

   Raj: Of course. I’d be happy to shred it on my ax.

   Howard: Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.

   Raj: Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.

   Sheldon: Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little
   breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your
   shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I
   don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your
   necks touching my buttocks.

   Howard: Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.

   Raj: Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for
   creating a new heavy element is inspired.

   Sheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned
   a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear
   Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were
   extremely promising.

   Leonard: Sheldon, that’s incredible.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since
   the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the
   Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they
   know how to keep people in line.

   Howard: So, what happens next?

   Sheldon: Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but
   don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe
   I’ve always been.

   Leonard: Good to know.

   Sheldon: Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Thank you so much for coming.

   Raj: You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect
   romantic evening for you to give Leonard.

   Penny: Okay, good, ’cause I’ve been really struggling with
   this.

   Raj: As I’m sure you’re aware, the quickest way to a man’s
   heart is through his…

   Penny: Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn’t count.

   Raj: Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and
   you just can’t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man’s
   heart is through his stomach.

   Penny: I don’t know if I want to cook for him. He’s kind of a
   picky eater. I mean, it’s too salty, it’s too dry, it’s too
   burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else
   would sweep you off your feet?

   Raj: Well, I’ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing.
   The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But
   boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in
   the big dance competition.

   Penny: Okay, that’s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else
   would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze’s
   head.

   Raj: Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a
   boom box in the air.

   Penny: That’s from Say Anything.

   Raj: Look, I’m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look,
   Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from
   you.

   Penny: I get that, but why is this so hard?

   Raj: Well, you’ve probably never had to do this stuff ’cause
   you’re young and beautiful and men have always thrown
   themselves at you.

   Penny: Yeah, I’m trying to be sad about that. I can’t.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic
   Marker I was using when I made the discovery.

   Amy: I don’t think the Smithsonian’s gonna want your marker.

   Sheldon: And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort.
   Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in
   Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter
   of his suspicious mole yesterday.

   Amy: Sheldon, I’m so proud of you.

   Sheldon: Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like
   wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size
   of a navy bean.

   Amy: What’s next?

   Sheldon: This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and
   Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium
   and…

   Amy: And what?

   Sheldon: No. No, no, no, no.

   Amy: What’s wrong?

   Sheldon: I’ve made a horrible mistake.

   Amy: What are you talking about?

   Sheldon: This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as
   square metres. You know what that means?

   Amy: That Americans can’t handle the metric system?

   Sheldon: Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

   Amy: But the Chinese team found the element.

   Sheldon: Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were
   wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I
   didn’t know about.

   Amy: So you just got lucky?

   Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.

   Amy: You and me both, brother. It doesn’t matter. The element
   was found because of you, and that’s groundbreaking.

   Sheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of
   my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud.

   Amy: You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we’re forever finding
   something in one part of the brain that we thought was
   someplace else.

   Sheldon: Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically
   a biologist.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Leonard:: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I
   mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.

   Sheldon: There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit
   that I don’t deserve.

   Leonard: Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time.
   Look at me with you.

   Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of
   my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every
   textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that
   time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a
   way to stop this thing.

   Leonard: Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out
   there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science
   equivalent of a sex tape.

   Sheldon: You know, frankly, I’d prefer a sex tape.

   Leonard: You don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?

   Sheldon: No.

   Scene: The cafeteria.

   Howard: Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight.
   Bernadette’s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don’t want
   to blow the surprise.

   Leonard: We’ll be there.

   Raj: Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was
   thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.

   Howard: E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.

   Raj: Come on, come on, you haven’t even heard it yet. Leonard,
   give me a beat.

   Leonard: I will not.

   Raj: Oh, please?

   Howard: No, I want this to be romantic.

   Raj: It will be. I don’t call anyone a ho, and the only time I
   use the phrase my bitch, I’m referring to you.

   Voice: There he is. (General applause)

   Sheldon: Stop it. Stop celebrating me.

   Voice: Woo!

   Sheldon: And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want
   you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My
   so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was
   nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from
   praising me for it in the future.

   Raj: Wait, I don’t understand. They didn’t find the element?

   Sheldon: Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No,
   no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the
   likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?

   Leonard: Invite them to live with us.

   Scene: A restaurant.

   Penny: Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.

   Leonard: Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so
   romantic.

   Penny: Okay, you know what’s not romantic? Rubbing it in
   someone’s face.

   Leonard: Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count.

   Howard: I’m getting worried about Bernadette. I’m gonna call
   and check on her.

   Sheldon: The National Science Foundation wants to give me a
   substantial grant.

   Raj: Oh, that’s a big deal.

   Sheldon: I know. When will this nightmare end?

   Leonard: Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention,
   but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you.

   Amy: I’m not.

   Sheldon: You’re not?

   Amy: Sheldon, I’ve been thinking about it, and you’re right.
   You don’t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some
   numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I’m
   embarrassed for you.

   Sheldon: That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.

   Penny: Damn it, everyone’s better at this than me.

   Sheldon: Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.

   Howard: Guys, there was an accident at Bernie’s lab.

   Leonard: Oh, my God, is she okay?

   Howard: Yeah, but she’s at the hospital in quarantine.

   Penny: What?

   Amy: Poor Bernadette.

   Leonard: Oh, no.

   Sheldon: I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a
   raise.

   Scene: The hospital.

   Howard: Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?

   Bernadette: Well, let’s just say the next time you move a dozen
   vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips.

   Howard: You’re sure you’re okay?

   Bernadette: Yeah, it’s just a precaution. If there was a
   problem, I’d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I
   messed up our date.

   Howard: Oh, don’t worry about it. I brought the date here.
   Guys, come on in.

   Bernadette: What’s all this?

   Howard: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and
   I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.

   Bernadette: Howie.

   Amy: Sheldon, get over here.

   Sheldon: She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a
   rough enough day?

   Amy: Sheldon.

   Howard (singing): If I didn’t have you, life would be blue, I’d
   be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.

   Sheldon: Is it me, or does she not look so good?

   Amy: Shh.

   Howard: A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I’d
   be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I’d be cheese without
   the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I’d be solving exponential
   equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it
   much harder to crack. I’d be an atom without a bomb, a dot
   without the com, and I’d probably still live with my mom.

   All: And he’d probably still live with his mom.

   Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You
   supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You’re like
   uranium-235 and I’m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I
   couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from the
   moment that I met you Bernadette.

   Bernadette: Oh, Howie.

   Howard: If I didn’t have you life would be dreary, I’d be
   string theory without any string. I’d be binary code without a
   one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I’d be
   Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I’d speak a
   lot more Klingon, Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam.

   All: And he’d definitely still live with his mom.

   Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around.
   You’re my best friend and my lover. We’re like changing
   electric and magnetic fields. You can’t have one without the
   other. I couldn’t have imagined how good my life would get from
   the moment that I met you, Bernadette.

   All: Oh, we couldn’t have imagined how good our lives would get
   from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.

   Bernadette: Howie, that was amazing. Look, I’m shaking.

   Sheldon: She’s sick, I knew it. Bye.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever
   made.

   Penny: I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet.
   That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready,
   ’cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.

   Leonard: Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem
   pretty confident.

   Penny: Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you’ll see
   why.

   Leonard: Oh, rose petals.

   Penny: Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all
   the flowers.

   Leonard: You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the
   stops.

   Penny: Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found
   something to show you how much I love you.

   Leonard: Oh, wow.

   Penny: It’s a first edition of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the
   Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.

   Leonard: This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: Nothing. I love it.

   Penny: No. Something’s going on. What’s wrong with it? I
   remember you saying how great it would be to have a first
   edition.

   Leonard: It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the
   used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I
   bought it.

   Penny: Oh, my God, I am the worst.

   Leonard: No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful.

   Penny: No, it’s not. I mean, what’s thoughtful is everything
   you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here’s the,
   the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home
   for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just
   because. Here’s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after
   the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.

   Leonard: I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.

   Penny: Of course I did. It’s you.

   Leonard: Come here.

   Penny: Oh.

   Leonard: Is that a pregnancy test?

   Penny: Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn’t save them all.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.

   Amy: Me? What did I do?

   Sheldon: You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment
   I met you.

   Amy: Sorry.

   Sheldon: Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is
   how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on
   the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.

   Amy: Oh, Sheldon.

   Sheldon (not in Amy’s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory):
   Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?

   Amy: Can’t talk, in the zone.
