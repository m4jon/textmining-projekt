Series 3 Episode 06 – The Cornhusker Vortex

   Scene: The stairwell. The guys are carrying kites.

   Leonard: Kites, ho!

   Howard: Kites ho!

   Raj: Kites ho!

   All three: Kites, ho!

   Sheldon: Excuse me. You’re misusing the word ho. It’s an
   interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an
   object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!

   The three guys: Kites, ho!

   Penny: Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover
   electricity?

   Leonard: If you’re referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin,
   he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to
   determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also
   invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary
   catheter. Kites, ho.

   Leonard: We’re heading out for some kite fighting.

   Penny: Kite fighting?

   Leonard: Oh, yeah. It’s an extremely competitive, cutthroat
   sport.

   Sheldon: Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very
   low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and
   ever-Present danger.

   Leonard: You want to come watch?

   Penny: Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I’ve got some friends
   coming over. Not a big thing, we’re just gonna watch the
   Nebraska game.

   Leonard: Oh. Football, sure.

   Howard: Good guess.

   Penny: I would’ve invited you, but I know you’re not a football
   fan.

   Leonard: No, no, I’m not, so, great. You’ve got plans doing
   something you like, I’ve got plans doing something I like, so
   it’s good.

   Penny: Well, maybe we’ll hang out later, you know, after
   everybody’s gone.

   Leonard: Yeah, great.

   Penny: See ya.

   Leonard: Well, this sucks.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly
   in the interaction did the sucking lie?

   Raj: Leonard just realized that Penny’s been hiding him from
   her friends because he’s a tiny, little man who flies kites.

   Sheldon: Oh, that certainly would suck.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The park.

   Sheldon: Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some
   string, add altitude and I’ll go under and cut his line.

   Leonard: Why wouldn’t Penny want her friends to meet me?

   Sheldon: Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us,
   the dogs of war are unleashed.

   Leonard: Maybe Koothrappali’s right, maybe I embarrass her.

   Sheldon: You’re embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying
   about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.

   Leonard: Sorry.

   Sheldon: Sorry won’t bring their kites down. Ow! String burn!
   String burn!

   Raj: Oh, they think we’re flanking, they’re playing right into
   our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying
   scissor. One, two…

   Howard: Whoa! Did you see that?

   Raj: See what?

   Howard: That chick, she smiled at me.

   Raj: No, she didn’t.

   Howard: Yes, she did.

   Raj: Come on, scissors, scissors!

   Howard: Hold my line.

   Raj: Wait, what are you doing? I can’t scissors by myself!
   Howard! Come back!

   Sheldon: Victory!

   Raj: Son of a bitch.

   Scene: Leonard’s car.

   Raj: You’re a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky
   friend.

   Howard: What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither
   look.

   Raj: If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.

   Howard: I would’ve caught up to her if I hadn’t pulled a hammy.

   Raj: Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don’t have a hammy.

   Leonard: So, Penny doesn’t want me around her friends, I
   embarrass her. What else could it be?

   Sheldon: Well, her actions could be out of concern for your
   feelings. Perhaps she’s excluded you from these gatherings
   because she’s scouting for a new mate and doesn’t want to do it
   in front of you.

   Leonard: Oh, how kind of her.

   Sheldon: Agreed. Most primates don’t show that sort of
   discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in
   front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?

   Raj: You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you
   don’t have a shot with.

   Howard: I totally had a shot.

   Raj: With a woman you were chasing through a park? That’s not a
   shot, that’s a felony. What’s worse, it cost me my prized
   Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don’t suppose there’s any
   chance you could give me my kite back?

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare
   dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules,
   the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the
   following would be an empty gesture. (Sings) I have your kite.
   I have your kite.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Leonard: Hey.

   Penny: Hi.

   Leonard: How was your football party?

   Penny: It was pretty good. We won.

   Leonard: Oh, that’s excellent. It’s a weird figure of speech,
   isn’t it, we won when you weren’t

   actually playing. When we watch Star Wars, we don’t say, we
   defeated the Empire.

   Penny: I’m glad to hear it.

   Leonard: Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to
   have me around your friends?

   Penny: Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?

   Leonard: Well, you know, I just noticed I haven’t really met
   any of them.

   Penny: Sure you have.

   Leonard: Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the
   smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here
   today?

   Penny: Of course not.

   Leonard: Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why
   am I rambling? Why don’t you stop me?

   Penny: Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that
   would be great. I just, you know, I didn’t want you to be
   bored.

   Leonard: I wouldn’t be bored. Why would I be bored?

   Penny: Well, ’cause they’re not genius scientists.

   Leonard: Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my
   best friends aren’t geniuses.

   Penny: Like who?

   Leonard: Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren’t geniuses. My
   point is, if we’re going to be a couple, I should be friends
   with your friends.

   Penny: Okay, great. Well, then why don’t you come over next
   Saturday and watch the game with us.

   Leonard: Another football game?

   Penny: They have them every week.

   Leonard: Did not know that.

   Penny: You wanted to meet my friends.

   Leonard: Sure, sure, just I don’t know much about football.

   Penny: Oh, that’s okay, a lot of the guys’ girlfriends don’t
   know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.

   Leonard: Great.

   Scene: The apartment. Leonard and Raj are watching a football
   game on the television.

   Leonard: Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I
   think I’m starting to get this.

   Raj: Really? The only thing I’ve learned in the last two hours
   is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have
   trouble getting erections.

   Leonard: Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.

   Raj: I’m just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer,
   you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women
   without pharmaceutical help.

   Howard (arriving): Raj, what are you doing here? You were
   supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.

   Raj: I’m sorry, are you under the impression that we’re still
   friends?

   Howard: Oh come on, you’re not still grinding on the kite
   thing, are you?

   Raj: It’s not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place,
   you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes
   along, even though you don’t have a shot with them.

   Howard: But I had a shot with that jogger.

   Raj: Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her.
   (Leaves)

   Howard: It’s not a little scooter. It’s the second biggest
   Vespa they make! Are you watching football?

   Leonard: There’s no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks
   statistic they put up there?

   Howard: All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.

   Leonard: Sacks, sacks…

   Sheldon: It’s football nomenclature for when a quarterback is
   tackled behind the line of scrimmage.

   Leonard: Huh… Scrimmage…

   Sheldon: The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line
   separating the offence from the defence.

   Leonard: Oh.

   Howard: Sheldon knows football?

   Leonard: Apparently.

   Howard: I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?

   Leonard: Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?

   Sheldon: I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas.
   Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee
   football, in fact, every form of football except the original,
   European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie
   plot.

   Leonard: Unbelievable.

   Sheldon: If you’re interested, I also know all about frying
   meat that isn’t chicken as if it were chicken.

   Leonard: So you could teach me?

   Sheldon: Football or chicken-fried meats?

   Leonard: Football. I’m going to Penny’s on Saturday to watch a
   game with her friends and I don’t want to look like an idiot. I
   want to blend in.

   Sheldon: If you want to blend in with Penny’s friends, I’d
   think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.

   Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football.
   It’ll be fun.

   Sheldon: That’s exactly what my father said. Come to the games,
   watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five
   until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.

   Leonard: Please, I’m asking you as a friend.

   Sheldon: Are you making this a tier one friendship request?

   Leonard: Yes.

   Sheldon: Fine.

   Leonard: I really appreciate this.

   Sheldon: Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up
   and listen.

   Leonard: I’m sorry?

   Sheldon: That’s how my father always began our football
   conversations. And if you’d like, after the game, I’ll take you
   outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon
   that it craps itself.

   Scene: The kitchen. Sheldon is making toast in a cylon toaster
   which burns an image of a cylon onto the toast.

   Leonard: When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?

   Sheldon: When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on
   the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you’re wearing
   to watch football at Penny’s?

   Leonard: What’s wrong with a football jersey?

   Sheldon: Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football
   cocktail dress.

   Leonard: I’s the smallest size they had, except the one for
   dogs. I can’t believe they had one for dogs.

   Sheldon: Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in
   Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My
   sister found that out the hard way.

   Leonard: Anyway, wish me luck.

   Sheldon: Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your
   attempt to be accepted by Penny’s peers is based on your desire
   to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?

   Leonard: Well, I wouldn’t put it exactly that way.

   Sheldon: How would you put it?

   Leonard: Yeah, okay, like you said.

   Sheldon: Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through
   for intercourse. Don’t you have access to women who will do it
   for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.

   Leonard: Good-Bye, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you
   not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon
   toast?

   Leonard: Yeah, no, I’m trying to fit in, not get laughed at.

   Sheldon: What’s funny about Cylon toast?

   Scene: Raj’s apartment. Raj is watching a Bollywood movie.
   There is a knock on the door.

   Raj: It’s open.

   Howard: Hey, pal.

   Raj: What do you want?

   Howard: I brought you a little gift. New kite.

   Raj: The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an
   Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi.
   It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is
   Hello Kitty.

   Howard: Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a
   Patang?

   Raj: Wow, you just don’t get it, do you? Buying me something
   pretty isn’t going to make our problem just go away.

   Howard: Look, I admit I haven’t always been the best friend I
   could be.

   Raj: You’ve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.

   Howard: Stipulated.

   Raj: And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio
   Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your
   mother, and I suddenly realize you’re not even there.

   Howard: I know, I know.

   Raj: And where were you?

   Howard: Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick.
   But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer
   to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was
   like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.

   Raj: You’re impossible.

   Howard: Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.

   Raj: Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical
   disorder. You’re just a douche.

   Howard: No. You know what? Maybe that’s what this whole thing’s
   about. You’re not mad at me, you’re mad at yourself.

   Raj: No, I’m mad at you. I hate myself, but I’m mad at you.

   Howard: Fine. You’re mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go
   spend the day together? Just the two of us. We’ll go anywhere
   you want.

   Raj: I don’t know.

   Howard: Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.

   Raj: I… I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.

   Howard: Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it’s…
   okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let’s go.

   Raj: Oh, why can’t I stay mad at you?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment. Everyone is watching football.

   Leonard: Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching
   this? Is this amazing or what?

   Penny: Sweetie, that’s a highlight from the ’98 championship
   game.

   Leonard: Oh. Did not know that.

   Penny: How much beer have you had?

   Leonard: None, why?

   Penny: Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we’re
   back live.

   Leonard: Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.

   Guy in baseball hat: Oh, where’s the flag, that’s intentional
   grounding.

   Second guy: Totally.

   Leonard: That completely was a forward pass, which they threw
   intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to
   conserve time. I can’t believe they’re not being penalized with
   the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage
   back to the spot of the foul.

   Penny: Here, have some pizza, sweetie.

   Leonard: Penny, you know I’m lactose intolerant.

   Penny: I know. I just need you stop talking.

   Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)
   Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.

   Penny: Sheldon, come in.

   Sheldon: Thank you. I’d like to make a sandwich, but I’m out of
   bread.

   Penny: There’s some in the fridge.

   Sheldon: You shouldn’t keep your bread in the refrigerator.
   Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules,
   which occurs faster at cool temperatures.

   Penny: On Earth, we say thank you.

   Sheldon: So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?

   Leonard: Mimesis?

   Sheldon: You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes
   on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.

   Leonard: What the hell are you talking about?

   Sheldon: I’m attempting to communicate with you without my
   meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try
   again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their
   own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.

   Leonard: Oh, I guess so.

   Sheldon: Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I’m taking
   Koothrappali’s Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like
   to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?

   Leonard: I don’t want to fly kites, Sheldon. We’re watching
   football here.

   Sheldon: I can see that. I was providing you with an
   alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar
   circumstances.

   Leonard: Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a
   red flag indicating he’s challenging the ruling on the field. I
   hope he’s right, ’cause if he’s not, it’ll cost him one of his
   three time-Outs.

   Penny: You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn’t mind if you wanted
   to go fly kites with Sheldon.

   Leonard: No, I’ll watch the end of the game. Besides, there’s
   only three minutes left.

   Penny: Until half time.

   Leonard: This is just half? We’ve been here for hours.

   Penny: And you’re gonna be here for a couple more.

   Leonard: Oh, you’re kidding me.

   Penny: No.

   Leonard: Nice meeting all of you.

   Penny: So, yeah, anyway, that’s my boyfriend. He is really
   smart.

   Scene: The Le Brea Tar Pits.

   Raj: I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.

   Howard: My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie
   Callender’s and have some pie.

   Raj: I’d like that. This is turning out to be a perfect
   Saturday.

   Howard: Good. I’m glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled
   at me?

   Raj: Fine. Go ahead.

   Howard: No. This is our day.

   Raj: If you want to chase after her, chase after her.

   Howard: Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn’t have a shot with a
   girl like that.

   Raj: Don’t put yourself down. You’re a very attractive man.

   Howard: You think so?

   Raj: Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn’t kill you to take a Pilates
   class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.

   Howard: Yeah, well, it doesn’t matter ‘cause she wasn’t really
   smiling at me.

   Raj: Actually, in this case, I think she was.

   Howard: Really?

   Raj: Yeah.

   Howard: Bye.

   Raj: What a douche.
