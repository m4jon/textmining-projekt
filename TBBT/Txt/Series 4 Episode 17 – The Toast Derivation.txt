Series 4 Episode 17 – The Toast Derivation

   Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.

   Sheldon: Buona sera, Luigi’s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good
   evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you
   calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?

   Leonard: Okay, I’m out of here.

   Sheldon: Un momento. Oh, for heaven’s sake, now you’re being
   deliberately stupid. (to Leonard) Where are you going?

   Leonard: I’m having dinner with Priya at Raj’s. I think
   Howard’s going to be there. You want to join us?

   Sheldon: But tonight’s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes
   over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by
   someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like
   Jackie Chan.

   Leonard: Can’t we make a one-time exception for tonight?

   Sheldon: We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I
   think that idea is isguided and oronic.

   Leonard: Just come with me to Raj’s.

   Sheldon: Well, I don’t want to go to a party.

   Leonard: It’s not a party. It’s the same group of people who
   hang out here, hanging out over there.

   Sheldon: I’m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a
   party.

   Leonard: How come it’s not a party when we do it here?

   Sheldon: Because we don’t throw parties.

   Leonard: I don’t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I’m going to
   see Priya. Everyone’s over there. You coming or not?

   Sheldon: Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word,
   tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you
   and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to
   break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues
   of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich
   heritage means nothing to you.

   Leonard: I guess you’re right. See you later.

   Sheldon: Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?

   Leonard: Come with me to Raj’s and eat there.

   Sheldon: I can’t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood
   pudding?

   Leonard: I really doubt that’s what he’ll serve.

   Sheldon: But what if he does? I’ll be obliged to dine on liver
   and lungs stuffed in a sheep’s stomach. And frankly, blood
   pudding is essentially the same thing. I don’t know why he’s
   serving both.

   Leonard: What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or
   do you want to sit here alone?

   Sheldon: No, I’ll go to your haggis party. But I’m telling you,
   this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.

   Credits sequence.

   Sheldon: Oh, dear!

   Leonard: What?

   Sheldon: Raj’s television. I just realized we’re about to spend
   an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead
   pixels in the upper left-hand corner.

   Leonard: So don’t watch TV. Read a book.

   Sheldon: And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my
   style.

   Leonard: Ugh!

   Sheldon: The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?

   Leonard: Right.

   Sheldon: Is it about me or the dead pixels?

   Raj: Hey, you’re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.

   Leonard: Oh, sounds great.

   Sheldon: Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the
   Chinese pizza.

   Priya: Hey, you.

   Leonard: Hi.

   Howard: That’s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter
   suck the saliva out of your sister’s mouth?

   Sheldon: Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we
   need to decide where everyone is going to sit.

   Priya: There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere.
   Make yourself comfortable.

   Sheldon: Oh, what fun. We’re like hippies at a love-in.

   Leonard: Just sit here.

   Sheldon: Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it’s Harry
   Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer’s Stone.

   Raj: Okay, we’ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make
   your own.

   Sheldon: Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.

   Priya: Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?

   Sheldon: A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?

   Scene: The bar of the Cheesecake Factory

   Penny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?

   Sheldon: Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.

   Penny: Where are all your friends?

   Sheldon: Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight,
   roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape,
   and a stern expression for my cowl.

   Penny: Okay.

   Sheldon: Excuse me? Isn’t this the point where the world-weary
   barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes
   out of the troubled patron?

   Penny: Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right.
   What’s troubling you, buddy?

   Sheldon: I don’t think your heart’s in it, but since you asked.
   Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj’s sister, we’re all
   forced to hang out at his apartment.

   Penny: Oh, the horror.

   Sheldon: Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music,
   and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of
   Caligula. (Phone rings) Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?

   Penny: Ugh!

   Sheldon: Wonder what she’s exasperated about. Hello?

   Amy (on phone): Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke,
   you were going to take a taxi home from Raj’s, but according to
   Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.

   Sheldon: Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn’t look at
   all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran
   for it.

   Amy: Wise.

   Penny: There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in
   the Caribbean.

   Amy: Hi, bestie.

   Penny: Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?

   Amy: Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.

   Penny: Yeah, it’s a great time to be alive, isn’t it?

   Sheldon: Don’t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens
   finish your clucking.

   Penny: Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying
   with Raj. That means you’re all probably gonna be hanging out
   there more.

   Amy: Penny, I’m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you’re
   devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new
   lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.

   Penny: Okay, I’m not upset about Leonard and Priya.

   Amy: Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.

   Sheldon: Cluck-cluck-cluck.

   Amy: Sheldon, look at me. I think it’s time to face the fact
   that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he
   goes, the group goes.

   Sheldon: Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I’m the
   whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.

   Amy: I’m not saying that you’re not fun. You’re the most fun
   person I know.

   Penny: A lot of people think I’m fun to be around.

   Amy: Don’t be needy, bestie. That’s probably part of what
   chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your
   group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be
   Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it
   were the birthplace of motion pictures, we’d all be singing
   Hooray for Leonardwood.

   Penny: Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you’d be called
   Leonard and the Leonards.

   Amy: So needy.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: What you doing?

   Sheldon: I’m setting out snacks.

   Leonard: You do realize everyone’s eating at Raj’s again
   tonight?

   Sheldon: I didn’t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy
   Rosie?

   Leonard: You’re having people over?

   Sheldon: Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I’ll
   tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from
   the university, Penny’s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV’s LeVar
   Burton.

   Leonard: Really? LeVar Burton’s coming here?

   Sheldon: Possibly. I Tweeted him.

   Leonard: Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.

   Sheldon: Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new
   friends.

   Leonard: Of course. Good night.

   Sheldon: Leonard.

   Leonard: Yeah?

   Sheldon: We had a good run, you and I.

   Leonard: Okay.

   Sheldon: But change is a part of life.

   Leonard: It certainly is.

   Sheldon: Okay. I have guests coming. I’m afraid I’m going to
   have to ask you to leave now.

   Leonard: I am leaving.

   Sheldon: Don’t make this harder than it is, Leonard.

   Leonard: Good-bye, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: And good-bye to you, sir. He’ll be back.

   Leonard: Of course I’ll be back. I live here!

   Scene: The apartment, later.

   Sheldon: Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won’t be joining us
   so let’s get started. Um, I thought we’d begin by going around
   the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about
   why we’re here. Okay. I’m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of
   The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no
   introduction. If you’re not familiar with that publication,
   there’s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?

   Stuart: Um. Hi. I’m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for
   financial reasons, I’m currently living in. And I guess what
   I’m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.

   Sheldon: That’s very nice, Stuart. Zack?

   Zack: I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… uh… could you come back to me?

   Sheldon: Of course. Barry?

   Barry: I’m Barry Kwipke, and I’m here because you told me there
   was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?

   Sheldon: Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle… the raffle is
   the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.

   Barry: One more question…

   Sheldon: Yes, you must be present to win.

   Zack: Okay, I’m ready. I’m Zack, and I’m, uh… oh, crap, why is
   this so hard?

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: Oh, hey.

   Bernadette: Hi.

   Amy: Yo, P-dog.

   Penny: What’s up?

   Bernadette: We’re here to kidnap you for a girls’ night out.

   Amy: Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.

   Penny: I kind of figured that.

   Amy: Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.

   Penny: No.

   Amy: She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in
   the heart.

   Bernadette: We just thought you might want to go out and have a
   good time, maybe go dancing.

   Penny: Oh. Gee, thanks, but I’m not really in the mood.

   Amy: You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing
   over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is
   currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.

   Penny: Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you
   promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?

   Amy: Yes.

   Bernadette: Sure.

   Penny: All right. I’ll go change. Come on in.

   Amy: If you’d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn’t
   have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Zack: Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the
   lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There’s no one around, so
   naturally, I’m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this
   beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get
   in with me.

   Sheldon: Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

   Barry: Weally? That’s your question?

   Zack: What’s the difference?

   Sheldon: Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic
   term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are
   Jacuzzis.

   Zack: Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers
   are thumbs?

   Sheldon: Surprisingly, yes.

   Zack: Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?

   Stuart: Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I’d like
   something to think about in the shower.

   Zack: Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her
   clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice…

   Sheldon: The water level rose.

   Zack: No.

   Sheldon: Of course it did. It’s said that Archimedes, the
   ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of
   displacement while taking a bath.

   Barry: Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl,
   fwee-balling, continue.

   Sheldon: Forgive me, but I think you’ll find my story is more
   interesting.

   Barry: Does yours have wet bweasts in it?

   Sheldon: Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king
   wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with
   coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly
   shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its
   volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could
   immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.

   Zack: So, long story short, I nailed her.

   Sheldon: When he finished, he shouted Eureka!

   Zack: No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don’t know why. Just do.

   Sheldon: All right, that concludes the getting to know you
   portion of the evening. Who’s ready to play some vintage video
   games? And tonight’s selections include ColecoVision’s Smurf
   Rescue in Gargamel’s Castle, Atari’s Cookie Monster Munch, and
   for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I’m
   fun.

   Barry: That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go
   get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow
   the woof off this place?

   Zack: Great, I’ll make a beer run.

   Stuart: And I’ll take a shower. We’ll meet back here in
   fifteen.

   Barry: Check.

   Sheldon: I’m unhappy.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Leonard: This is delicious. Where’d you learn to make chili?

   Priya: When I was at university in England, my flatmate was
   from Texas.

   Leonard: I hope she wasn’t anything like my flatmate from
   Texas.

   Priya: Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn’t he?

   Howard: Oh, please. That crazy bastard’s looking at quirky in
   the rearview mirror.

   Leonard: Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have
   to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the
   sink. We each have special buckets.

   Howard: Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time
   Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?

   Priya: Oh, God, you’re kidding.

   Raj: Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went
   up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren’t so
   distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a
   little more thought into Windows Vista.”

   Leonard: Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.

   Raj: I’d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful
   Sheldon-free evening.

   Leonard: Hear, hear.

   Howard: Cheers. You realize that’s the first time we’ve ever
   done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it’s
   called a toast?

   Priya: Why is it called a toast?

   Leonard: Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch
   bowls.

   Raj: Sheldon tells it better.

   Leonard: He kind of does.

   Howard: Yeah.

   Leonard: Aw, hell, I miss him.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So, where do you guys want to go dancing?

   Bernadette: We were hoping you’d know a place.

   Amy: Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young,
   beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a
   glorious orgy of the flesh.

   Penny: Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?

   Amy: That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new
   mate, or a hungry infant.

   Penny: Okay, let’s go through this one more time. Just because
   Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and
   hook up with some guy.

   Bernadette: But you could if you wanted to, right?

   Penny: Well, yeah, I guess.

   Bernadette: Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him
   home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb
   with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?

   Penny: More or less.

   Amy: What’s that like?

   Penny: I don’t know. It’s fun while you’re doing it. And then
   after, it’s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.

   Bernadette: I would take that deal all day long.

   Penny: Yeah, well, it’s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for
   the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I’m
   totally okay with it.

   Amy: You know, if being on your own is new to you, I’d be happy
   to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I’ve
   perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric
   toothbrush?

   Penny: Um, no.

   Amy: You should get one.

   Bernadette: What’s that?

   Amy: It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of
   acrylic.

   Penny: Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave
   it to me last year.

   Bernadette: Oh, God, that is so romantic.

   Penny: Yeah, it was.

   Bernadette: Leonard’s really one of a kind.

   Amy: Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit
   heavy-handed, don’t you think?

   Penny: Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little
   self-loathing. Let’s go find me a heinie to bite.

   Amy: Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and
   pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.

   Bernadette: That’s kind of creepy.

   Scene: The apartment. Barry and Zack are singing “Don’t Go
   Breaking My Heart”

   Stuart: Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?

   Sheldon: No.

   Stuart: Dibs.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Priya: I’m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to
   weave?

   Leonard: He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching
   serapes.

   Raj: I still wear mine when there’s a nip in the air.

   Priya: Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?

   Leonard: Long before the cats. I think it was around the time
   he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still
   have some of the currency.

   Sheldon (outside): (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends.
   (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All
   my friends.

   Howard: I think it’s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too
   many times.

   Raj: Come on in.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Leonard: Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.

   Sheldon: I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.

   Priya: Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Priya: Would you like some homemade chili?

   Sheldon: Are there beans in it?

   Priya: Yes.

   Sheldon: Then it’s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it,
   but you’re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.

   Priya: Sheldon, do you want some or not?

   Sheldon: Yes, please. Your girlfriend’s a little
   short-tempered.

   Raj: I’d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how
   quirky.

   All: Cheers.

   Sheldon: Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?

   Priya: Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced
   toast in their punch bowls.

   Sheldon: She’s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good.
   Whatever it is.

   Scene: The apartment. Stuart is singing “Walking on Sunshine”.
   Barry and Zack are doing backing vocals.

   LeVar Burton: Hello? I… Oh, I don’t think so. I am so done with
   Twitter.
