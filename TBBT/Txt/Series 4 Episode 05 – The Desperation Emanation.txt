Series 4 Episode 05 – The Desperation Emanation

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: All I’m saying is, if they took all the money they
   spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably
   just make an actual Hulk.

   Sheldon: That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that
   with Amy Farrah Fowler. She’ll appreciate the witticism.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: It’ll also help improve her initial impression of you.

   Leonard: So what’s going on with you two?

   Sheldon: Well, the status is as it always was. She’s a girl.
   She’s a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing
   this, girlfriend.

   Leonard: Right, right. So you’re still just texting and
   emailing? You don’t feel any need to hang out with her, you
   know, be in the same room?

   Sheldon: Leonard, you are my best friend. I’ve known you for
   seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch
   with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical
   proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.

   Leonard: Got it.

   Sheldon: I sense judgment on your part.

   Leonard: No, no. Maybe a little.

   Sheldon: May I suggest that your criticism is based on
   jealousy.

   Leonard: Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?

   Sheldon: I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with
   a female. You have none.

   Leonard: Oh, right. That.

   Sheldon: Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the
   Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this
   iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the
   girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good
   romp if there ever was one.

   Leonard: I’m not jealous.

   Sheldon: Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an
   infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there’s
   probably a Sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes
   exist.

   Leonard: Probably. What’s your point?

   Sheldon: No point. It’s just one of the things that makes one
   of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?

   Leonard: Hmm, recently? Not much.

   Sheldon: Is it because of the conflict that arises from your
   desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent
   collective decision of all womankind to deny you that
   opportunity?

   Leonard: Um, shut up.

   Sheldon: You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was
   alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a
   week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It’s
   very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot
   meal.

   Leonard: That sounds lovely.

   Sheldon: It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?

   Leonard: Sheldon, I’m just not dating someone right now. I
   don’t need to go to a senior centre.

   Sheldon: Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.

   Leonard: Fine. If I don’t meet someone soon, you can put me in
   a home.

   Sheldon: It’s not a home. It’s a senior centre.  We’d never put
   Meemaw in a home!

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Leonard: Hey, guys.

   Howard: Hey.

   Raj: Hey.

   Sheldon: All right, I’ll bow to social pressure. Hey!

   Howard (phone rings): Excuse me. That’s my girlfriend,
   Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The
   Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.

   Raj: When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which,
   now that I think about it, is not so good.

   Leonard: You realize he’s just rubbing our noses in the fact
   that he has a girlfriend, and we don’t.

   Rai: You mean, you don’t.

   Leonard: You have a girlfriend? How could you have a
   girlfriend? You can’t even speak to women.

   Raj: Two words, deaf chick. It doesn’t matter if I can’t talk,
   because she can’t hear me.

   Leonard: What?

   Raj: That’s what she said.

   Leonard: Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard’s got a
   girlfriend, Sheldon’s got a girl…

   Sheldon: No, no, no, no!

   Leonard: …who’s a friend.

   Sheldon: Thank you.

   Leonard: What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?

   Stuart: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place
   in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual
   pickup line.

   Leonard: Oh. Well, good for you.

   Stuart: Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex,
   she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who
   wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?

   Leonard: Why don’t you just break up with her?

   Stuart: No, no, I can’t.

   Leonard: Why not?

   Stuart: ‘Cause then I’d be alone, like you.

   Raj: Dude, why don’t you just invoke your girlfriend pact with
   Wolowitz?

   Leonard: Because I don’t need his girlfriend to set me up with
   one of her girlfriends. I’m perfectly capable of finding a girl
   on my own.

   Raj: Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a
   man who walks into a women’s correctional institution with a
   stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go
   free.

   Leonard: You’re saying I couldn’t get laid in a women’s prison
   with a handful of pardons.

   Raj: Are you going to let me tell the story or not?

   Scene: The apartment. Leonard is stretched face down on the
   sofa.

   Sheldon: Leonard? Are you sleeping?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Are you ill?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: Are you still depressed because you’re alone, and no
   one loves you?

   Leonard: I don’t know. Maybe.

   Sheldon: I want you to know that I’m genuinely concerned about
   your well-being.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: You’re welcome. But it’s still no reason to have your
   feet in my spot.

   Amy (on webcam): May I offer an observation?

   Leonard: What the hell? How long has she been here?

   Sheldon: Since we got home from the comic bookstore.

   Leonard: That was two hours ago.

   Sheldon: As per your suggestion, we’re hanging out. Quite
   frankly, I don’t see what all the hoopla’s about. Go on, Amy.

   Amy: From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be
   alone because your psychological state is causing an actual
   pheromone-based stink of desperation.

   Sheldon: Did you know that, Leonard?

   Leonard: No.

   Sheldon: I did.

   Amy: I understand that some people find mates in social
   gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar
   or tavern?

   Leonard: No, I’m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.

   Sheldon: Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based
   on classic male attributes such as height, strength,
   attractiveness, the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw
   darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these
   attributes, right, Leonard?

   Leonard: Right.

   Amy: That’s not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.

   Sheldon: Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise,
   Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the
   Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?

   Leonard (exiting the apartment): Keep going. I’m listening.

   Amy: That was rude.

   Sheldon: He does it all the time. He’s a cornucopia of social
   awkwardness.

   Amy: Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.

   Sheldon: Let’s make that our word of the day.

   Amy: Agreed. And we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow.

   Sheldon: Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending
   this time with you.

   Amy: Wait. I have a request.

   Sheldon: Yes?

   Amy: I’d like you to meet my mother.

   Sheldon: I see. Can I get back to you on that?

   Amy: Certainly. Good night.

   Sheldon: Good night. (Closing laptop, and running down stairs
   in panic) Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,

   Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
   Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,
   Leonard, Leonard.

   Leonard: Yeah, what?

   Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.

   Leonard: Yeah. So?

   Sheldon: What does that mean?

   Leonard: Well, you know how you’re always saying that Amy is a
   girl who’s your friend, and not your girlfriend?

   Sheldon: Uh-huh.

   Leonard: You can’t say that anymore.

   Sheldon: Wait. What?

   Leonard: Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to
   the next level.

   Sheldon: I don’t want the next level. I like this level. Fix it
   for me!

   Leonard: Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?

   Sheldon: Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be
   someone’s girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my
   blessing.

   Leonard: That is insane.

   Sheldon: You’re right. It would never work. Amy finds you
   tedious.

   Leonard: Okay, good luck.

   Sheldon: Wait! What am I supposed to do?

   Leonard: Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?

   Sheldon: Leonard, I’m a physicist, not a hippie.

   Leonard: All right, well, let me see if I can explain your
   situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached
   to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around
   an axis?

   Sheldon: Screwed.

   Leonard: There you go.

   Sheldon: Amy’s right. He is tedious.

   Scene: Outside Howard’s house. Leonard rings bell.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, get the door!

   Howard (off): Why can’t you get it?

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): You know I’m doing a bowel cleanse for my
   colonoscopy! I’m like an upside-down volcano here.

   Howard: Oh, hey. I hope you didn’t hear that.

   Leonard: The volcano thing? No.

   Howard: What’s with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store
   now?

   Leonard: No, it’s just something I threw on.

   Howard: I know all your shirts. That’s not one of them. You
   were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women,
   weren’t you?

   Leonard: Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don’t
   guard the shirts.

   Howard: So, how’d it go?

   Leonard: It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl
   how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and,
   well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in
   the mall.

   Howard: Just FYI, don’t try to go back with a fake moustache. I
   mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right
   through that.

   Leonard: I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.

   Howard: You that desperate?

   Leonard: No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a
   woman in my life.

   Mrs Wolowitz (off): Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one
   tukus?

   Leonard: To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.

   Howard: Yeah, I know what you mean.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Well, I’m off to meet Bernadette’s friend. How do I
   look?

   Sheldon: As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body
   Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd
   amount of hair gel.

   Leonard: What are you working on?

   Sheldon: I’m removing my digital footprint from the Internet so
   Amy Farrah Fowler can’t find me and compel me to meet her
   mother.

   Leonard: Ah, you’re going off the grid.

   Sheldon: Exactly.

   Leonard: The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.

   Sheldon: Thank you. I’ve also sent Amy a relationship
   termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail
   address.

   Leonard: What if she just comes over?

   Sheldon: She’ll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles.
   We now live at 311 Los Robles.

   Leonard: You changed the address on the building? What about
   mail?

   Sheldon: Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our
   letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got
   your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.

   Leonard (there is a knock on the door): Who is it?

   Amy (off): Amy Farrah Fowler.

   Sheldon: Darn! She found me!

   Leonard: She’s been here before.

   Sheldon: The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get
   my back, Jack.

   Leonard: What do you want to do?

   Sheldon: Tell her I’m not here.

   Leonard: Okay, where are you?

   Sheldon: I don’t know. You’ll have to devise a scenario that
   plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to
   a good lie lies in the details.

   Leonard: Hi, Amy. Sheldon’s not here.

   Amy: All right. (Leaves)

   Sheldon: Way to go on the details.

   Scene: A restaurant.

   Leonard: Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.

   Bernadette: Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my
   lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went
   missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we
   crossed Ebola with the common cold.

   Howard: Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common
   cold?

   Bernadette: We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible
   thing.

   Girl (arriving): Hi. Sorry I’m late, I was at the gym. Spin
   class. Worked up quite a sweat.

   Bernadette: Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.

   Leonard: Hi.

   Joy: Hi. You don’t look like a genius. Go ahead, say something
   smart.

   Leonard: Uh…

   Joy: Aah! Time’s up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know
   about me, I’m hilarious.

   Leonard: Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from
   self-defence classes?

   Joy: Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred
   different ways to rip a guy’s nuts off.

   Leonard: Wow. Wouldn’t think there’d be that many.

   Joy: Number 42!

   Leonard: Whoa!

   Bernadette: Isn’t she a pip?

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon (rhythmically, while walking down the stairs): Proxima
   Centauri’s the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow
   are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard’s Star, Wolf 359, Lalande
   21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross
   248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn,
   that’s wrong! (Heads back up stairs) EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii
   B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are
   nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. (Sees Amy standing
   in lobby) Oh, dear. They really do be crazy.

   Scene: The restaurant.

   Joy (burping): This lobster’s good on the way down and the way
   up.

   Leonard: Should be, it’s thirty dollars a pound.

   Joy: Hey, this is a date, right?

   Leonard: Yep, it is.

   Joy: 73!

   Leonard: Whoa!

   Joy: Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls’ room and take
   a wicked whiz.

   Bernadette: I’ll go with you.

   Joy: Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink
   up the place.

   Howard: I think she likes you.

   Scene: The stairwell. Amy is sitting on the bottom step.

   Sheldon (wearing a heavy coat and false nose and glasses): EZ
   Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.

   Amy: Sheldon?

   Sheldon: Rats!

   Amy: I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I
   asked you to meet my mother.

   Sheldon: No misunderstanding. I’ve learned what that request
   actually means, and I don’t want to be joined to another object
   by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.

   Amy: In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present
   you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that
   I’m in a relationship.

   Sheldon: So we’d be perpetrating a ruse?

   Amy: Precisely.

   Sheldon: And you haven’t fallen hopelessly in love with me?

   Amy: Don’t be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be
   an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human
   relationships.

   Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler, that’s the most pragmatic thing
   anyone has ever said to me.

   Amy: I trust this clarification allows us to return to
   boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.

   Sheldon: Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?

   Amy: Sheldon, please, you’re suffocating me.

   Sheldon: My apologies. Good night, Amy.

   Amy: Good night, Sheldon.

   Scene: The restaurant.

   Howard: Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she’ll grow on
   you.

   Leonard: Or maybe she’ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts
   off. There are still 93 ways she hasn’t tried yet. Look,
   Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst
   date of my life.

   Howard: Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I
   met on J-Date, and that didn’t even crack my top ten.

   Leonard: I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.

   Howard: Not that I’ve ever seen.

   Leonard: It’s relatively new. I just know that I’m not gonna
   spend time with someone I don’t like simply to have a
   girlfriend. I’m okay on my own.

   Joy: Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.

   Leonard: Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but…

   Joy: Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I
   need a date for my cousin’s wedding.

   Leonard: You’re asking me out?

   Joy: Yeah. And it’s an open bar, so I’ll probably be giving it
   away.

   Leonard: I look forward to it.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Mrs Fowler (on webcam): It’s nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I
   honestly didn’t believe Amy when she told me she had a
   boyfriend.

   Sheldon: I assure you I am quite real and I’m having regular
   intercourse with your daughter.

   Mrs Fowler: What?

   Sheldon: Oh, yes. We’re like wild animals in heat. It’s a
   wonder neither of us has been hurt.

   Mrs Fowler: Amy, what is he saying?

   Amy: You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he
   is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in
   my loins.

   Sheldon: Oh, yes, it’s time for me to make love to your
   daughter’s vagina.

   Mrs Fowler: Oh!

   Amy: Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.

   Sheldon: Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should
   actually engage in coitus at least one time in our
   relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.
