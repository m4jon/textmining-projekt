Series 9 Episode 07 – The Spock Resonance

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Did you hear about this study that found people that
   were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in
   life?

   Raj: Hmm. I’m doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.

   Penny: In school?

   Raj: Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at
   my jokes. I wish I knew their names.

   Penny: Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?

   Leonard: You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.

   Sheldon: Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil
   Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that
   he started with his father before he passed away. It’s about
   Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.

   Leonard: Why is he writing to you?

   Sheldon: Well, they’re looking for fans to interview, and Wil
   thought I’d be good for it.

   Raj: Oh. Hey, high five.

   Sheldon: Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in
   front of the camera. Any words of advice?

   Penny: Yes. Don’t take your shirt off just because the director
   said so.

   Sheldon: This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I’m sure if
   there’s nudity, it will be tasteful.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.

   Bernadette: Hey. You got a minute?

   Howard: Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.

   Bernadette: Pause the game, Howard.

   Howard: Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‘Sup?

   Bernadette: We need to talk about redecorating this place.

   Howard: Oh, no, not this again.

   Bernadette: Look, I get that you grew up here and you’re
   attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to
   feel like my house, too.

   Howard: Oh, honey, of course it’s your house. Why else would
   you be cleaning it all the time?

   Bernadette: All right. Let’s start over. I’m redecorating. The
   furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I’m changing everything
   that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those
   things.

   Howard: May I say something?

   Bernadette: Is it about how I can’t have new wallpaper ’cause
   your dad left when you were little and your mom died?

   Howard: Never mind.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon (on phone): Hello, Amy. It’s Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know
   that we’re broken up, but I’m leaving this message because I
   thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a
   documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a
   Spockumentary. Yeah, I’m going to use that joke in the
   interview, so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first
   time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness
   that I’m no longer in your life.

   Leonard: I’m the one who thought of Spockumentary.

   Penny: And I’m laughing like I did the first time I heard it.

   Sheldon (answering door): Hello.

   Wil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.

   Adam: Nice to meet you.

   Sheldon: Oh, it’s nice to meet you. I admire your father’s work
   very much. It’s not every day I get to meet someone whose
   life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum.

   Wil: I told you. This guy is gold.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.

   Bernadette: Whatcha doing?

   Howard: Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used
   to make me after my dad left, but before she died.

   Bernadette: Okay, listen, I’m thinking that maybe we can
   compromise on the house.

   Howard: I’m listening.

   Bernadette: Let’s just redo one room and see how it goes.

   Howard: That is reasonable. But what room?

   Bernadette: How ’bout this one?

   Howard: No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with
   my mom.

   Bernadette: Then how ’bout the bathroom?

   Howard: I want to change my answer.

   Bernadette: Fine. Then the dining room.

   Howard: I guess we didn’t use it very often. Unless we had
   company. Which didn’t happen much after my dad left and not at
   all after my mom…

   Bernadette: Great. I’m gonna go pick out paint samples.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Adam: All right, we’re just gonna have a conversation. Pretend
   the camera’s not here.

   Sheldon: All right. But this better not be some elaborate
   scheme to get me out of my shirt.

   Leonard: How long have you known Adam?

   Wil: A few years.

   Leonard: And what are you getting him back for?

   Adam: Let’s start with your name and occupation.

   Sheldon: Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.

   Adam: And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?

   Sheldon: The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I
   ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on
   the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head,
   and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek,
   not my brother’s sphincter-based cuisine.

   Adam: What was it about Spock that appealed to you?

   Sheldon: I think the same thing that appeals to people
   everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely
   without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only
   by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are
   you hitting yourself? the answer is, I’m not. You’re moving my
   arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch
   educational television.

   Penny: Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug
   him and make everything better.

   Leonard: My brother was mean to me, too.

   Penny: Yeah, you probably had it coming.

   Adam: Do you have any Spock collectibles?

   Sheldon: I have many. My most treasured is an autographed
   napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That’s
   her over there.

   Penny: Hi. Look at that. I’m in a movie, my shirt stayed on.

   Adam: Can we see the napkin?

   Sheldon: Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.

   Leonard: When did we get a wall safe?

   Sheldon: When there was no more room in the floor safe.

   Leonard: When did we get a floor safe?

   Sheldon: When we got the security camera.

   Leonard: There’s a security camera?

   Sheldon: Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.

   Penny: Oh, my God. We’ve done things on that couch.

   Sheldon: Yeah. You don’t have to tell me.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.

   Raj: So, your father-in-law is in there right now?

   Howard: Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.

   Raj: Oh, okay. Got it.

   Howard: Hey. What’s going on?

   Raj: Hey.

   Bernadette: Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking
   down this wall.

   Raj: You sure? It’s a pretty great wall.

   Mr Rostenkowski: What’s so great about it?

   Raj: I’m sorry. I did what I could.

   Bernadette: Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?

   Howard: Your dad’s on your side.

   Bernadette: He’s not on my side. He’s doing all the work for
   free.

   Raj: That is so generous of you. I’d like to switch sides.

   Howard: Look, uh, I don’t even think you can take this wall
   down ’cause it’s load-bearing.

   Raj: Well, it’s easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace
   under the house and check.

   Howard: When is your visa up?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped
   his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard
   Nimoy’s DNA.

   Wil: Um, doesn’t Adam count as Leonard Nimoy’s DNA?

   Sheldon: No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of
   your mother, you’re only 50%. Which isn’t bad, but anything
   that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.

   Penny: Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in
   there?

   Sheldon: Wouldn’t you like to know?

   Penny: I would.

   Sheldon: All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport,
   uh, my will.

   Leonard: You have a will?

   Sheldon: Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also
   have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to
   Wil.

   Leonard: Will Wil want it?

   Wil: Wil won’t.

   Penny: Oh, what’s that ring box?

   Sheldon: Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to
   give my girlfriend Amy.

   Penny: What?

   Leonard: You bought her a ring?

   Sheldon: No, no. This has been in my family for generations.
   Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my
   great-great-great-grandmother’s finger and stole it.

   Wil: Sheldon, that’s awful.

   Sheldon: No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their
   village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy
   ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.

   Penny: Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?

   Sheldon: No. She broke up with me before I could broach the
   subject.

   Leonard: Oh, man, I’m sorry, that must have been devastating
   for you.

   Sheldon: No, not at all. No, I’m fine. You know, Amy had
   reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the
   best.

   Penny: I know. It just…

   Sheldon (shouting): I said I’m fine! (Long pause) We’ve gotten
   a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again
   in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard’s joke. As a
   child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to
   ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy
   neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn’t
   going to happen. But that’s why I changed it to, what would
   Spock do?

   Adam: Did you find that helpful?

   Sheldon: Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I
   discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of
   getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.

   Penny: I knew I could smell ’em.

   Adam: What about from when you were a kid?

   Sheldon: Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy
   Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would
   Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my
   first Vulcan nerve pinch.

   Adam: Did it work?

   Sheldon: Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it
   click.

   Adam: That must have been very upsetting for you.

   Sheldon: Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of
   emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I’ve
   spent a lifetime mastering.

   Penny: Oh pfft.

   Sheldon: Excuse me?

   Penny: I’m sorry. I’m not here.

   Sheldon: No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?

   Penny: Um.

   Leonard: You did go pfft.

   Penny: All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I’m no expert, but
   aren’t you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he
   liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half
   human.

   Leonard: Just like you.

   Penny: I’m just saying, you pretend you don’t, but you have
   feelings just like everybody else.

   Sheldon: Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to
   give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional
   about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about
   my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‘Cause I am
   just like him, all logical, all the time.

   Penny: Sweetie, you’re yelling.

   Sheldon: Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems
   to believe me that I’ve put this Amy nonsense behind me.

   Wil: This documentary is gonna be awesome.

   Scene: The crawlspace under Howard and Bernadette’s house.

   Mr Rostenkowski: You gonna be okay down here?

   Howard: Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones
   and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.

   Mr Rostenkowski: Yeah, that’s a rat skull.

   Howard: Oh.

   Mr Rostenkowski: Relax. There’s enough droppings down here
   without you making more.

   Howard: Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?

   Mr Rostenkowski: Yeah. I think that’s the den.

   Howard: Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.

   Mr Rostenkowski: Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don’t want
   to hear this, but it wouldn’t take that much work to turn that
   den into a nursery.

   Howard: Why wouldn’t I want to hear it?

   Mr Rostenkowski: ‘Cause Bernie said you didn’t want kids.

   Howard: That’s not true at all. I wish she’d get pregnant,
   believe me. I’m climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a
   loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want
   kids.

   Mr Rostenkowski: Huh.

   Howard: I don’t know why she’s lying to you. She’s the one who
   doesn’t want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject…

   Bernadette (above): Earthquake.

   Howard: Oh, my God, we’re gonna die.

   Bernadette: Aftershock.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Penny: I can’t believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.

   Leonard: I know. I also can’t believe he watched what we did on
   that couch and still sits on it.

   Penny: Yeah.

   Sheldon: Hello.

   Leonard: Hey, buddy. How you doing?

   Sheldon: Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Sheldon: Do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the
   documentary?

   Leonard: Oh, yeah.

   Penny: Definitely.

   Sheldon: Well, there’s no point in dwelling on it. As the
   Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha’kiv na’ish Du stau.

   Penny: Do you know what that means?

   Leonard: No.

   Penny: Are you telling the truth?

   Leonard: Nirsh.

   Sheldon: Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all
   the time isn’t accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve
   this situation, then I need to take action.

   Penny: What are you gonna do?

   Sheldon: I’m going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if
   she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our
   relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo
   miran.

   Leonard: He didn’t meant that.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s kitchen.

   Bernadette: So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.

   Howard: That would be nice.

   Bernadette: I told my dad that you were the one who didn’t want
   kids because I didn’t want to disappoint him.

   Howard: But you were okay throwing me under the bus?

   Bernadette: Turns out yeah, I didn’t think twice about it.

   Mr Rostenkowski: Bernie, you don’t need to worry about me. But
   I don’t want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most
   rewarding experience of my life.

   Bernadette: Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was
   come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is
   that raising kids?

   Mr Rostenkowski: This is really a conversation for husband and
   wife. I’m gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks,
   I was here till ten.

   Raj: It’s interesting your father didn’t help around the house
   and Howard doesn’t help, either, so in a way, Howard’s not only
   like your father, but he’s also like the child that you’re
   afraid to have.

   Howard: Why are you still here?

   Raj: Fine, I’ll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a
   fresh diaper.

   Howard: All right, I admit that I don’t help out a lot. And I
   need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be
   different.

   Bernadette: Why?

   Howard: Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I
   ever had a chance to be a father I’d always be there.

   Bernadette: Okay, I’ll think about it.

   Howard: And this an actual I’ll think about it, not like the
   can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I’ll think about it”?

   Bernadette: It’s an actual I’ll think about it.

   Howard: I really believe I’d be a great dad.

   Bernadette: I know you would.

   Howard: Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up
   and poke around your crawlspace?

   Scene: The street. Sheldon sees Amy with another man. He
   leaves.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Kirk (on screen): Dr. Dana feels he isn’t that dangerous. What
   makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?

   Spock (on screen): Because she feels. I don’t. All I know is
   logic.

   Sheldon: Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off.
   There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our
   children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I
   have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a
   made-up alien race with no emotions?

   Leonard: Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters,
   you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.

   Sheldon: Those are very wise words.

   Leonard: Thank you.

   Sheldon: They’d just be so much more comforting if they came
   out of a television.
