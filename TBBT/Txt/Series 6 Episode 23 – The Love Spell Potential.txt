Series 6 Episode 23 – The Love Spell Potential

   Scene: A taxi

   Bernadette: Burbank Airport, please.

   Penny: Vegas, here we come.

   Bernadette: No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules.

   Amy: No rules? We’re not gonna get drunk and have a six-way
   with the Blue Man Group, are we?

   Penny: No.

   Amy: So there are some rules.

   Bernadette: Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.

   Amy: Thank you. Vegas!

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: The ladies are away, the boys will play.

   Raj: Anything can happen.

   Leonard: It’s gonna get crazy.

   Sheldon: Dungeons & Dragons.

   Scene: The taxi.

   Penny: I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on
   these.

   Bernadette: I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither,
   and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack.

   Amy: I got some old underwear I’m gonna throw on stage at the
   Garth Brooks concert.

   Penny: I’m sorry, why old?

   Amy: ‘Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me
   nothing.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I’ve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral
   dice. Hello, new dice smell.

   Leonard: I’ve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed,
   and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma.

   Raj: I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay
   waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad
   for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want.

   Howard: Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch
   of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of
   teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage
   girls?

   Scene: The taxi.

   Girls: Vegas! Vegas! Vegas!

   Scene: The apartment.

   Boys: The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of
   Mofooskay-Heeko! The Dungeon of Mofooskay-Heeko!

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Raj: I’m actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the
   awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my
   bros.

   Howard: Isn’t every conversation you two have awkward?

   Raj: Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no
   one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.

   Howard: Ready whenever you guys are.

   Sheldon: Yeah, yeah, we’ll be right there. Leonard?

   Leonard: Yeah?

   Sheldon: I’m not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon
   master instead of you.

   Leonard: Oh, that’s nice. But relax, sometimes change is good.
   Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock,
   but you wound up liking him.

   Sheldon: Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up,
   you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I’m upset the mailman has
   a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset that daylight saving
   time started, Zachary Quinto. I’m upset daylight saving time
   ended, Zachary Quinto. I’m saying this for the last time,
   Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So
   stop using him against me.

   Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown
   old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it
   that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, (Nicolas Cage
   voice) Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones
   of many a fallen hero.

   Leonard: See, Howard’s just as good a dungeon master as I am.

   Sheldon: As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard,
   four-eyes.

   Raj: Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage
   tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors,
   and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. (Text
   sound) Oh, Lucy’s free after all. See ya.

   Leonard: Hey, hey, hey, you can’t leave. We just started.

   Raj: You’re right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one
   long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I’m dead, I’ve got
   a date with a girl. Bye.

   Howard: We’ll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises
   from Koothrappali’s bloody corpse, and says, (Raj voice) don’t
   worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the
   forest. (Nicolas Cage voice) Well, I’m just a tree, but if I
   were you, I’d listen to your ghost friend.

   Sheldon: Go on, give him your lunch money.

   Scene: A restaurant

   Raj: I’m very happy you were able to hang out tonight.

   Lucy: Me, too.

   Raj: Not that it’s up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless
   you find neediness sexy. In which case, you’re about to have
   dinner with the hottest man on the planet.

   Lucy: Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing
   you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant
   all over my body.

   Raj: Really?

   Lucy: Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head,
   you’ll know why.

   Raj: I, uh, I’m sorry to put you through that.

   Lucy: Oh, it’s okay. I’ve been trying to force myself to do
   things that make me scared.

   Raj: What else have you been thinking about doing?

   Lucy: Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who
   cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs.

   Raj: I like your bangs.

   Lucy: Oh, thanks, I like ’em, too.

   Raj: What else?

   Lucy: Mmm, it’s kind of a tie between sending food back in a
   restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines
   door-to-door.

   Raj: Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.

   Lucy: I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if
   it gives way.

   Howard: Uh, it does. (Creaking sound)

   Sheldon: He does sound effects, too!

   Leonard: Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of
   bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. (Clicking sounds)
   Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. (Strange howl)

   Sheldon: Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound
   effects. (Blows raspberry)

   Penny: Guess who?

   Howard: What are you doing back?

   Bernadette: That’s an excellent question. Amy?

   Amy: Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got
   pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a
   little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.

   Bernadette: Long story short, she’s on the No Fly List and we
   might have been followed here by a drone.

   Amy: I’m sorry. I feel like such an idiot.

   Penny: Oh, it’s not so bad. You lost money, you’re filled with
   shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that’s Vegas,
   you nailed it.

   Amy: You guys enjoy your evening. I’m gonna go before I ruin
   anybody else’s weekend.

   Sheldon: Ah, that’s my girl.

   Leonard: No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it’s not the night you
   had in mind, but why don’t you guys stay and play with us?
   It’ll be fun.

   Sheldon: It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought
   crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do
   you have a drug problem?

   Leonard: What’s the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some
   extra players.

   Sheldon: Well, I’ve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with
   girls before.

   Penny: Oh, don’t worry, sweetie. No one has.

   Leonard: So, what do you say?

   Sheldon: I’ll leave it up to the dungeon master.

   Howard: A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino
   rises from the forest floor and says, (Al Pacino voice) You’re
   playing D&D. You’re playing D&D. This whole apartment is
   playing D&D.

   Scene: Later, the same.

   Penny: Okay, who wants a drink?

   Sheldon: Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don’t consume alcohol during
   Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.

   Penny: Oh, this isn’t alcohol. It’s a magic potion that makes
   me like you.

   Leonard: Double potion, please.

   Howard: Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with
   two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall
   die!

   Sheldon: Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.

   Howard: What do you do?

   Leonard: I draw my broadsword.

   Sheldon: I ready my quarter-staff.

   Penny: I drink my potion.

   Bernadette: I say we attack the big one.

   Penny: You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.

   Howard: The dungeon master’s supposed to roll.

   Penny: Yeah, well I’m supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a
   shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?

   Howard: Uh, fifteen or higher.

   Penny: Fifteen’s the point, the point is fifteen. Give the
   little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes!
   Oh, please tell me we’re playing for money.

   Sheldon: Oh, even better than money. You gained experience
   points.

   Penny: More potion, please.

   Leonard: Yeah.

   Scene: The restaurant.

   Raj: How are your crab cakes?

   Lucy: Kind of funky.

   Raj: That’s great.

   Lucy: It is? Does funky mean something different in India?

   Raj: No, no. Uh, you’ve always wanted to send your food back in
   a restaurant, here’s your chance.

   Lucy: Mmm, it’s okay. I just won’t eat ’em.

   Raj: Don’t be ridiculous. Waiter?

   Waiter: Everything all right?

   Lucy: Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?

   Waiter: Yes.

   Lucy: ‘Kay, thanks, bye.

   Raj: Hold on. Isn’t there something else you wanted to tell
   him?

   Lucy: N-No, it, it’s fine. Uh, He’s from a different country,
   he doesn’t understand our ways.

   Raj: Don’t be silly. Just tell him.

   Lucy: I have to go to the bathroom. And it’s not because the
   crab cakes are funky.

   Waiter: So you’re okay here?

   Raj: Uh, yeah, sorry. She’s just a little shy. The first time
   we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window
   to get away from me.

   Scene: Lucy climbs out of bathroom window to find a locked
   gate.

   Lucy: Uh-oh. (Dials phone) Hey, Raj. Funny story.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Bernadette: Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.

   Howard: Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre
   says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.

   Sheldon: That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.

   Leonard: All right, Amy, there’s one ogre left. Take him out.

   Amy: Okay.

   Penny: Pretend he’s that TSA agent. Come on.

   Amy: Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than
   Vegas.

   Penny: No, it’s not.

   Scene: An alley behind the restaurant.

   Raj: Lucy?

   Lucy: Hey. Long time no see.

   Raj: You don’t know me very well, but each time you crawl out a
   bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my
   masculinity.

   Lucy: I’m sorry.

   Raj: Why would you leave like that?

   Lucy: You were pushing me. I clearly didn’t want to send my
   food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.

   Raj: Okay, if I upset you, then why didn’t you just say
   something?

   Lucy: Well, how can I tell you I’m upset if I can’t tell the
   woman at Supercuts that my forehead’s my best feature? It’s
   scary.

   Raj: Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that’s scary for me.
   Mostly because you’re a proven flight risk.

   Lucy: How could you like me a lot?

   Raj: Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional
   problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman.
   I, I don’t know. I just, I think you’re wonderful.

   Lucy: I’m sweating out of my head.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Howard: The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the
   volcano.

   Sheldon: Yay!

   Howard: But wait., he’s not dead. He crawls out, spreads his
   wings and prepares to attack.

   Sheldon: Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn’t he say something first? You
   know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?

   Howard: Fine. (Christopher Walken voice) You’d think, after all
   these years, I’d know not to fly over volcanoes. I’m a freaking
   idiot.

   Sheldon: The dragon’s Christopher Walken. That’s perfect.

   Leonard: All right, Amy, it’s your turn. We need one more hit.
   Finish him off.

   Amy: Here we go. Fifteen?

   Howard: It’s a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.

   Sheldon: Wait. Wait. And says?

   Howard: Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.

   Sheldon: Oh, I don’t know about you guys, but I have been
   through the emotional wringer tonight.

   Bernadette: This may be the potion talking, but you are one
   fine-ass dungeon master.

   Howard: Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I’m gonna take you on
   a whole different adventure.

   Sheldon: Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.

   Amy: Sheldon, they’re talking about sex.

   Sheldon: Oh, then I’m out.

   Penny: Ooh, I have an idea. Since it’s not happening any time
   soon, why don’t your character and your character do it in the
   game?

   Bernadette: Ooh! Come on, back me up here.

   Howard: Oh.

   Together: Ooh!

   Bernadette: Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.

   Leonard: Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.

   Howard: The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy,
   she is the most beautiful half-orc he’s ever seen, and he’s
   overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at
   her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well,
   just like Sheldon, ’cause apparently she’s into that. What do
   you do?

   Amy: I don’t like this.

   Sheldon: You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?

   Scene: Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock)
   Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.

   Amy: What?

   Sheldon: I’ve never knocked on my own door before. That was a
   wild ride.

   Amy: You don’t have to come in here and cheer me up.

   Sheldon: Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that?
   Because they sure think otherwise.

   Amy: I’ll tell you what they think. They think our relationship
   is a joke.

   Sheldon: Well, I don’t think our relationship is a joke. I
   think “a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long
   face?’, that’s a joke. It’s a good one, too, because a horse
   has a long face.

   Amy: Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate
   relationship?

   Sheldon: Oh, my. That’s an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I
   met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with
   anyone.

   Amy: And now?

   Sheldon: And now what?

   Amy: Do you have any interest now?

   Sheldon: I have not ruled it out.

   Amy: Wow. Talk dirty to me.

   Sheldon: I know it doesn’t seem like it to you, but, for me,
   what we have is extremely intimate.

   Amy: I guess I know that. It’s just, part of me wants more.

   Sheldon: More? I mean, look at us. It’s only been three years,
   here we are in bed together.

   Amy: Come on. Let’s go back out there.

   Sheldon: Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your
   half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We
   wouldn’t really be playing the game right if we didn’t see that
   through.

   Amy: Okay.

   Sheldon: I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the
   others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where
   I attempt to remove your leather armour. (Rolls dice) It comes
   off.

   Amy: Oh.

   Sheldon: What do you do?

   Amy: I kiss you on the lips.

   Sheldon: I kiss you back on the (Rolls dice) lips as well. Your
   turn.

   Amy: I remove your armour. What do you do?

   Sheldon: I erotically caress your (Rolls dice) nose.

   Amy: Keep rolling.

   Scene: Outside Sheldon’s bedroom.

   Leonard: Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You
   doing okay?

   Sheldon (off): We’re fine, thank you.

   Penny: Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about…

   Amy: Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my (sound of dice) 14!
   Yes!
