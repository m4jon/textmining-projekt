Series 9 Episode 04 – The 2003 Approximation

   Scene: The stairwell.

   Sheldon: What a wonderful day, thank you.

   Penny: Oh, we’re glad you had fun.

   Sheldon: Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It’s
   like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced
   hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.

   Leonard: I still don’t understand why you bought that pill
   caddie. You’re a young man.

   Sheldon: Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I’m 90. Why
   are you taking your bins over there?

   Leonard: It’s just where I need them. You know, she doesn’t
   have a lot of closet space.

   Sheldon: What’s wrong with your closet?

   Penny: Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are
   married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.

   Sheldon: So that’s all this day was? A plan to butter me up
   before delivering bad news?

   Leonard: Come on, buddy.

   Sheldon: No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of
   my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might’ve said yes.

   Penny: Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.

   Sheldon: You know what they don’t sell at The Container Store?
   Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although,
   if anyone did, it would be them.

   Credits sequence.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.

   Sheldon: Thank you for letting me come speak with you.

   Bernadette: Of course.

   Sheldon: As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently
   strained, I’m turning to you for female comfort and
   encouragement.

   Bernadette: Aw. I’m honoured.

   Sheldon: I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in
   Bible study. Leonard’s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was
   taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her
   answers.

   Bernadette: So, I’m your seventh choice.

   Sheldon: Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.

   Bernadette: How can I help you?

   Sheldon: Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard’s moving
   in with Penny. It’s difficult not to feel abandoned.

   Bernadette: Well, why don’t you look at this as an opportunity?
   You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance
   to find someone new.

   Sheldon: Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard.
   Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt’s all the rage right
   now. I wonder how he’d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.

   Stuart: Hey.

   Bernadette: Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?

   Sheldon: Gandalf, but he’s a smoker.

   Bernadette: Stuart. He’s been living with us for a while now.
   I’m sure he’d love to get us out of his hair.

   Stuart: Nope, couldn’t be happier.

   Bernadette: Well, Sheldon’s looking for a roommate.

   Stuart: Nope.

   Bernadette: He’ll think about it.

   Stuart: No I won’t.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Raj: Have you seen this Archie comic? It’s actually Archie
   versus Predator.

   Howard: How could Archie defeat Predator?

   Raj: I don’t know. Maybe Jughead’s a Terminator.

   Stuart: Hey.

   Howard: Hey, Stuart.

   Stuart: Do you guys know any musicians?

   Howard: Why?

   Stuart: I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here
   a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a
   staying in business vibe.

   Howard: What kind of music are you thinking of?

   Stuart: I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is
   free.

   Raj: Hey, we’ve always talked about playing together.

   Howard: Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.

   Raj: Oh, we could play filk music.

   Stuart: What’s that?

   Raj: It’s been around for years. It’s like folk music, but with
   a sci-fi/fantasy theme.

   Stuart: I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn’t
   be expected to pay for.

   Raj: Dude, if we do this, we’re gonna need a cool band name.

   Howard: You know, I’ve actually had one I’ve been sitting on
   for years.

   Raj: Really?

   Howard: It was for this power trio I tried to put together in
   junior high, but I was short two friends.

   Raj: What is it?

   Howard: Footprints on the Moon.

   Raj: I just got chills.

   Howard: So did I.

   Stuart: Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Just a few more signatures, and we’ll be finished.
   Initial here to acknowledge that you’ve returned your key.
   Okay. As my future neighbour, I’d like you to have a key.
   Initial here to acknowledge you received it.

   Penny: I’m proud of you. You’re taking this really well.

   Sheldon: Well, it’s not like I’m never going to see you two
   again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check
   here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.

   Leonard: Do I really have to do that now?

   Sheldon: No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the
   fish, that’s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial
   here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is
   hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the
   universe and all alternate universes except for those universes
   where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which
   case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that’s
   left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will
   officially no longer be roommates.

   Penny: What’s the matter?

   Leonard: It’s harder than I thought.

   Sheldon: Let me help you. L. E. O. N.

   Leonard: That helped.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj: So I have an idea for a filk song. It’s kind of a, a power
   ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.

   Howard: Is it cold in here, ’cause, oh, my.

   Raj: Okay, so it’s a, it’s a David and Goliath story. It’s
   about man against God. It’s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold
   Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.

   Howard: Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking
   mind.

   Raj: Okay, I don’t have it all worked out yet, but I was
   thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are
   so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that’s
   no man, it’s a Norse god.

   Howard: Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor
   raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that’s one bad
   mamma-jamma.

   Raj: That is, that is so good!

   Howard: Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.

   Raj: Okay, and here’s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and
   Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with
   bones.

   Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays
   with lightning, the other plays with bones.

   Howard: Oh, man, that rocks.

   Raj: Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?

   Howard: Yeah?

   Raj: That’s how much we’re gonna melt people’s faces off.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just
   need to ask you a few standard questions.

   Bespectacled Man: Sure.

   Sheldon: It says here you’re a chemist. Which element on the
   periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?

   Bespectacled Man: Is that supposed to be a joke?

   Sheldon: Looks like argon’s not the only one with an attitude
   problem.

   Fade to another candidate.

   Sheldon: In general, would you say that you smell better, worse
   or the same as you do right now?

   Fade to another candidate.

   Sheldon: I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but
   then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a
   Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really
   want to ask you is just can you just go?

   Fade to another candidate.

   Sheldon: You’re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I’ve
   got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you’re the
   frontrunner.

   Amy (on Skype): I’m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.

   Sheldon: But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And
   that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.

   Amy: I’m sure you’ll find somebody else.

   Sheldon: I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was
   completely disengaged from my feelings. I’d say it was a
   happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can
   tell?

   Amy: I don’t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a
   part of life.

   Sheldon: They didn’t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you
   all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man,
   perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.

   Amy: I don’t think that was the point of the movie.

   Sheldon: Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk
   Geppetto went and made him a real boy.

   Amy: There you go.

   Scene: Penny’s apartment.

   Penny: So, what are you thinking for dinner?

   Leonard: Well, it’s Thai food night.

   Penny: Well, honey, you don’t live with Sheldon any more. You
   can have anything you want.

   Leonard: You’re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German?
   Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean
   barbecue?

   Penny: How about Thai food?

   Leonard: Oh, thank God.

   Penny: Hey, we’re going to dinner. You want to come?

   Sheldon: Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I’ve become too
   emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I’m
   restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in
   2003, the day before I met Leonard.

   Leonard: You heard him, no.

   Penny: Hang on. Wait, you actually think it’s 2003?

   Sheldon: No, just because I’m living my life like it was 12
   years ago doesn’t mean I’m delusional. And since it is 2003, I
   don’t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I
   call the police on my stylish new flip phone.

   Scene: A Thai restaurant.

   Penny: Are you doing okay?

   Leonard: I guess. I’m just, you know, worried about Sheldon.

   Penny: Well, come on, he’s a grown man in his 30s pretending to
   be a grown man in his 20s. He’s fine.

   Leonard: I hope so.

   Penny: What else can you do? Move back in with him?

   Leonard: No, of course not. I just feel bad.

   Penny: Well, so do I, but don’t you want to live with your wife
   and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body
   tell you when it’s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a
   schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?

   Leonard: I did like that he had the weather on it.

   Penny: Trust me, this is the right thing.

   Leonard: I know. And it’s not like we’re abandoning him. Plus,
   we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones
   are invented in his universe.

   Scene: A bar.

   Bernadette: I can’t believe Sheldon asked you to be his
   roommate.

   Amy: I can’t believe he ran my credit.

   Bernadette: Hey, if you’re open to living with someone great,
   I’ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.

   Amy: You really should’ve gone on the Internet and checked how
   long that kind of thing lives before you got one.

   Bernadette: I’m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty,
   weirdo-shaped hole in your life.

   Amy: Hey, I know Sheldon’s quirky, but he’s also brilliant and
   insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.

   Scene: The apartment.

   Sheldon: Hello, 2003.

   Leonard: Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?

   Sheldon: In my present, it’s in the future. In your present,
   it’s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I
   met in The Home Depot parking lot.

   Leonard: I know what you’re doing. You’re trying to get
   attention so we’ll feel bad for you, but it’s not happening.

   Sheldon: No, what I’m doing is trying to figure out how to live
   my life now that everyone is leaving me.

   Leonard: Will you knock it off? We’re across the hall.

   Sheldon: As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.

   Penny: They’re not saying that.

   Sheldon: They are in 2003.

   Penny: No, no, they’re really not.

   Scene: Raj’s apartment.

   Raj (singing): Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs
   from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?

   Emily: Wow.

   Raj: Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I
   couldn’t rhyme anything with boulder.

   Emily: Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.

   Raj: Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?

   Emily: I think it’s very cute.

   Raj: Cute? It’s not cute. Cute is children dressed as
   vegetables.

   Emily: Okay, fine, it’s not cute.

   Raj: Just be honest. You don’t like it.

   Emily: I didn’t say that. I, I just like music you can dance
   to.

   Raj: You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones.
   Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays
   with bones.

   Scene: Howard and Bernadette’s house.

   Raj: I’m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can’t
   dance to it.

   Howard: Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on
   the Moon was to write songs that make people think.

   Raj: You can do both, like Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean. While
   you’re dancing you’re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is
   it?

   Howard: Where’s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both
   loved this song.

   Raj: I still love it. I just think there’s room for
   improvement.

   Howard: You played it for Emily, didn’t you?

   Raj: Yeah, so what?

   Howard: You are such a wimp. She didn’t like it, now you don’t
   like it.

   Raj: No, no. I’m just evolving as a musician. You’re the one
   who’s stuck in the past.

   Howard: The past was lunch. You know what’s really happening
   here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.

   Raj: She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.

   Howard: Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever’s willing to
   sleep with you.

   Raj: That is so not true.

   Howard: Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised
   for Rachel Bernstein?

   Raj: That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction
   to a bad zipper injury.

   Howard: I don’t need this. I’m quitting the band.

   Raj: Fine, I quit, too.

   Howard: Then get out of my house.

   Raj: With pleasure.

   Howard: Raj, wait.

   Raj: What took you so long?

   Scene: The apartment.

   Leonard: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big
   change, but it’s not.

   Sheldon: How can you say that? Amy’s gone, and you two are
   married now, so it’s only a matter of time before you’re gone,
   too.

   Penny: Okay, you don’t know what’s gonna happen.

   Sheldon: No, I do. Eventually you’ll want more space, and
   you’ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple
   of times a week, it’ll only be a couple of times a month, and
   then it’ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette
   divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali’s weird
   girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy’s wedding,
   where she’s marrying someone better than me.

   Penny: Okay, look, we don’t need to rush into anything. All
   right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just
   leave things the way they are, and sometimes we’ll sleep over
   there, and sometimes we’ll sleep over here.

   Sheldon: But mostly here.

   Penny: Sure.

   Leonard: Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?

   Penny: Well, it’s not forever. It’s just for a while. If you
   want, we can think of him like he’s our dog.

   Sheldon: You can. I’m happy when you come home. And I’m scared
   of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we’re all sleeping
   here.

   Leonard: Fine.

   Sheldon: All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I’ll
   get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from
   Pratt, we’re good.

   Scene: The comic book store.

   Howard (singing): Indy’ whip snapped, Thor’s hammer missed.

   Raj (singing): It was Avenger versus archeologist.

   Howard: Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.

   Raj: Thor said, that’s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.

   Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays
   with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones.
   Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays
   with bones.

   Stuart: Play something we can dance to.
